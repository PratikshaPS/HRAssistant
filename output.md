We would like to align our policy guidelines with employee needs as well as those of the organisation. Therefore, KFSL may change these policies at any time. This Manual is therefore designed to allow updates (deletions and additions) as and when the management of KFSL deems it necessary for the general benefit of the Employees and the Company.

As we move ahead, there will be changes that may need to be reflected in this manual. When such revisions occur, the Custodians will receive these updates along with directions to whether to replace a page in a particular policy or simply replace the entire policy within a section.

# Interview Guidelines

It is the responsibility of the interviewer to brief the candidate on the current role available, a brief background of the organization, the culture prevalent in the organization, and the location at which the role will be based.

# Basic Interviewing Guidelines:

- Do not make the candidate wait for more than 15 minutes.
- Be punctual and start the interview on time.
- Be presentable, greet the candidate, and ask for his well-being.
- Begin by talking about things of common interest to help break the ice.
- Ask open-ended questions and let the candidate do most of the talking.
- Do not intimidate the candidate even if his reply to your question is incorrect.
- Take notes during the interview.
- Explain the role in terms of expectations and responsibilities.
- Close by thanking the candidate for showing interest in our organization.
- Provide a realistic time frame for informing the candidate about the interview outcome.

For outstation candidates, a video conference (VC) should be preferred over a telephonic interview.

# Post-Interview Process:

The line manager and HR must fill up the interview assessment sheet (IAS) immediately after the interview while the experience is still fresh. This is a mandatory requirement for all interviews.

# Travel Reimbursement:

If a candidate travels from one city to another for an interview, the company will reimburse travel and incidentals. It is advised to schedule interviews so that candidates can return the same day. If not possible, accommodation will also be reimbursed. Eligibility for travel, boarding, and lodging will be according to the travel policy applicable to the candidate's proposed grade. Line managers are responsible for minimizing travel, and all travel must be pre-approved by the CEO and KFSL HR.

# Pre-employment Screening:

Once the line manager and HR agree on the candidateís suitability, KFSL HR will conduct the following pre-employment checks:

- De-duplicate with the internal customer database (to check for any defaults).
- De-duplicate with the internal negative database (to check for any past interview history with the company).

Upon satisfactory results, KFSL HR will prepare a comparison sheet, which will be forwarded to the CEO for approval after recommendations from the line manager and interviewers. Once approved, the offered compensation and grade will be communicated to the candidate.

# Documents Required Before Offer Letter Release:

- Resume of the candidate.
- Interview assessment sheet filled by the line manager and HR.
- Clearance from the pre-employment checks.
- Photo ID proof.
- Last 2 months' salary slip.
- Copy of the last revision letter/appointment letter if no revision has been done.

# Joining Process

On acceptance of the offer letter, the prospective employee needs to communicate a tentative date of joining to HR. Once the employee joins the company, He/She is to be issued a formal appointment order. The appointment order can be issued by KFSL HR or Group Head HR.

# Notice Period Buy-Out

This option has to be exercised sparingly on a case-to-case basis. The line manager needs to keep in mind the level & criticality of the role before recommending for a buyout. The line manager needs to forward the requisition with the approximate amount to KFSL HR with a justification on the urgency of the recruit. KFSL HR will then get this approved by the CEO and Group Head HR. Desirably, the tenor of the buyout shall not exceed 30 days. This amount shall be reimbursed to the employee on production of proof of deduction and payment to the previous employer. However, in case the employee voluntarily terminates his/her employment within 12 months of joining, this amount will have to be recovered with his/her final settlement.

# Recruitment ñ Associate Trainee Program

# Objective

To provide business with resources for specific short-term projects simultaneously providing exposure to students who have to undertake projects as a part of their curriculum.

# Scope

All trainees hired.

# Process

Identification and grading of management institutes has to be an ongoing exercise. Based on this exercise, KFSL shall embark on identification of institutes from where associate trainees can be hired.

The plan should contain the following:

- Project guide
- Title of the project
- Department in which the project will be undertaken
- Stipend payable (if any)
- Date of start and tenure of the project

On approval of this plan from the CEO, KFSL HR will identify the institutes which can be visited to fulfill the requirement of trainees.

# Interview Process

The following grid has to be adhered to while interviewing and finalizing an Associate Trainee:

- Tier 1 & 2: CEO and KFSL HR
- Tier 3: VP level vertical head and KFSL HR

The interviewer is expected to understand the capabilities and requirements of the trainee. The project details like the title, tenor, etc. should be shared during the interview discussion. The prospective trainee also needs to submit an introduction letter from his institute.

On successful completion of the training, the trainee is to be issued a letter of completion.

# 2.4 Hiring of Relatives

# Objective

To ensure that wherever employees related to each other are working in the organisation, they are not in a position to influence the jobs, performance or career progression of one another.

The companyís recruitment philosophy is hiring purely on merit. There is no restriction on hiring of relatives till such time it does not create a potential conflict of interest. In order to avoid potential conflict of interest and to reduce the possibility of favouritism or appearance of favouritism, the following guidelines must be followed:

- No one is assigned to a position where he/she has the opportunity to check, process, review, approve, audit or otherwise affect the work of the other related employee.
- No one is assigned to a position where he/she can influence the salary progress or promotion of the related employee.

In case any employee knows of a situation that appears to be an opportunity for one employee to show favouritism to his/her relative, he/she should contact the KFSL HR.

Example of relatives, for the sake of understanding is Parents / In-laws, Spouse, Children, Siblings etc. However, the list is not limited to relations defined above.

# Process

The HR department maintains data on related employees and updates it on a monthly basis. This list is to be reviewed by HR/Compliance on a quarterly basis.

All new hires must declare in their joining kit, if they have any relatives working with the Karvy Group to the best of their knowledge.

# Performance Appraisal Process

1. Step 2: Within 10 days of receipt of the confirmation appraisal form, the supervisor should have a formal discussion with the appraisee. This discussion should revolve around the appraiseeís performance on KRA for the specific period, any limitations he/she has in executing his/her duties, etc.
2. Step 3: Post the personal discussion, the supervisor and the appraisee should arrive at a consensus on the performance during the last five months. In case they are not able to arrive at a consensus, the matter has to be referred to the skip level supervisor and HR. The decision of the skip level supervisor and HR shall be final.
3. Step 4: Based on the discussion, the supervisor needs to inform HR either on confirmation of services or extension of probation for the appraisee. Extension can be granted for a span of 1 to 3 months depending on the discussion of the supervisor, skip level manager, and HR. In case of extension of probation, the supervisor should share a performance improvement plan with the appraisee along with defined timelines for the achievement of the same. Whichever is the case, probation extension and confirmations have to be finally approved by the CEO.
4. Step 5: Confirmation/probation extension letter has to be issued to the appraisee. In case a probation extension letter is issued, it has to be accompanied with a copy of the performance improvement plan. The performance improvement plan has to be drafted by the line manager.
5. Step 6: (Only for probation extension cases) There has to be a fortnightly discussion on the appraiseeís progress on the performance improvement plan. Steps 1 to 5 have to be repeated while nearing the completion of the extended probation period. In case the employee under consideration does not scale up on performance parameters, the employeeís services can be terminated post discussion and approval of the immediate line manager, division/region/vertical head, CEO, and KFSL HR.

# Eligibility

All permanent employees on the rolls of the company are eligible for LTA.

# Scope

For employees at all levels, LTA is fixed and is mentioned on the appointment letter/increment letter.

LTA entitlement can be claimed once in a financial year. However, for tax exemption purposes, LTA is exempt only twice in a block of 4 years as defined by the Government. If LTA is not claimed during the financial year, the same shall be carried forward to the next financial year.

As per Income Tax rules, actual train fare for AC first class/Economy air fare for the employee and dependent family members by the shortest route to the destination of travel is exempt from tax. Original train tickets for train travel or the original air ticket along with boarding pass for air travel must support the claim. No travel agent bill/photocopied tickets shall be accepted. In case of travel by road, the employee needs to attach the LTA Declaration Form along with his/her claim.

If a round journey between multiple locations is being undertaken, then tax exemption shall not be given on the entire trip, but only on the expenses incurred on traveling between two farthest locations (up and down) in the trip.

In case the place of travel is not connected by train/air and is undertaken by road, an amount equivalent to AC first class fare for the distance of the journey by shortest route is reimbursable on the basis that the journey has been performed by rail. Original taxi bills shall be required as proof of travel in this case.

Employees need to avail a minimum of 3 working days leave to claim LTA. All LTA claims must be supported by the approved leave application and documents as mentioned in the policy.

# Process

LTA claims do not need the supervisorís signature and should be sent directly to HR. The LTA claim should contain an Expense Claim along with the following supporting documents:

- If the journey is undertaken by air, then the original tickets along with boarding passes.
- If the journey is undertaken by railway, then the original train tickets.
- If the journey is undertaken by road, then the details need to be filled in a subscribed format, which is available with HR.

LTA claims shall not be processed if:

- Photocopies of bills/tickets are sent.
- Tickets are not sent with the claim form.
- The claim form is incomplete.
- Only a travel agent's bill without tickets is given.

# 5.9 Provident Fund Benefit Policy

# Objective

To comply with the statutory regulations governing employee provident fund.

# Eligibility

The benefit of Provident Fund is extended to all employees from the date of joining their services with the company under the Employee Provident Fund & Misc. Provisions Act, 1952.

The rate of contribution is as given below:

- Employerís contribution: 12% of Basic salary per month
- Employeeís contribution: 12% of Basic salary per month

The contribution of both the employer and employee are operated through the monthly payroll. The monthly PF contribution for all employees of the company is deposited with the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner.

An employee may increase his/her contribution under the Voluntary Provident Fund to a maximum of 20% of the Basic salary. This is an internally set limit, though there is no limit set by the act. In such a case, the concerned employee must inform the HR department about his/her decision to increase the contribution. This change can be effected only at the beginning of a new financial year.

The employerís contribution remains fixed at 12% of Basic Salary per month.

# 5.10 Gratuity Benefit Policy

# Objective

To comply with the statutory regulations governing employee gratuity.

# Eligibility

The benefit of Gratuity is extended to all employees from the date of joining their services with the company under the Gratuity Act 1972.

The amount of gratuity payable is 15 days salary for every year of completed service in the company calculated on the basis of 26 days a month on the last basic salary drawn immediately preceding the date when the employee becomes entitled for gratuity under the scheme.

No Gratuity is payable if on the date of leaving the service the employee has not completed 1700 days of continuous service. However, in cases where termination of service is caused due to retrenchment, superannuation, death, physical disability of the employee, or transfer to any other associate/group company and the company to which he is transferred does not agree to take over the responsibility for payment of gratuity, the qualifying period of five years is not necessary for determining the eligibility for gratuity.

No Gratuity is payable if the services of an employee are terminated due to disciplinary action or if any action inquiry or legal suit is pending against the employee at the time of his leaving the service with the company. If an employee dies while in the services of the company, the amount of Gratuity payable in such an event is made payable to his/her spouse or, if there is no spouse, to his dependent children or other dependants.

# Performance Management Process

# Objective

- To provide a framework for systematic planning of performance objectives at the beginning of the year.
- To ensure congruence between individual objectives & organizational goals.
- To identify the gaps in performance for the purpose of development.

# Scope

All employees on rolls of the company will be eligible to participate in the performance management process; however, employees who have joined on or before the last day of October will be eligible for the financial increment arising out of this exercise in the same appraisal year.

# Process

The appraisal year is defined as the financial year i.e. April to March.

The process commences with a performance planning/goal setting exercise in which the Key Result Areas (KRAs) for all individuals are defined at the beginning of the year through a discussion between the employee and supervisor. The onus to set the KRAs for new joiners is on the new joinee and the supervisor. The KRAs should be submitted to KFSL HR duly approved by the CEO latest by 30 days after joining.

# Time Lines

The performance review has to be done quarterly, at the end of the financial year all the quarterly ratings are to be collated which helps in arriving at an annual rating for the individual.

1. At the end of the quarter, the employee has to fill in his achievements against the agreed KRAs. He/She also needs to allocate a score to the achievement based on the rating sheet below.
2. The employee will also define weightage (%) for every KRA. The sum total of all weights should be 100.
3. Appraisal discussion with supervisor: during the appraisal discussion between the supervisor and the employee, the supervisor will review the ratings provided by the employee and the relative weights allocated to individual KRAs.
4. The supervisor can alter the ratings/weights if he/she deems it fit.
5. The supervisor will then identify areas for improvement for the employee based on the discussion which have to be documented in the form.
6. Once there is consensus on the rating, the form has to be signed by the employee and the supervisor. (The employee can take a copy of the signed form for his records)
7. Post the rating by the supervisor, the same has to be reviewed by the skip level manager and subsequently by the CEO for manager level and above and division/region/vertical head.

For calculation of mandatory leave, paid holidays falling within the leave period will be counted as part of the leave.

To ensure that all employees avail their mandatory leave during the calendar year, it is recommended that all employees submit a tentative mandatory leave schedule to their Supervisors at the beginning of the year. The Supervisors then ensure that employees avail their leave in a staggered fashion throughout the year, without bunching up the leave either at the beginning or at the end of the year.

# Sick Leave

Sick leaves can be granted at the discretion of the supervisor, KSFL HR, and CEO. The immediate supervisor can approve up to 3 days of continuous leave. Any sick leave beyond 3 days at a stretch has to be approved by the CEO. Such leave application will have to be supported by adequate proof.

# Maternity Leave for Female Employees

Wherever applicable, maternity leave shall be governed by the provisions of the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961. This will apply to cases where an employee adopts a child also.

No employee will be entitled to Maternity Leave unless she has worked in the company for a period not less than eighty days in the twelve months preceding the date of her expected delivery. An employee will be entitled to twelve weeks maternity leave with full pay.

All reporting managers are responsible for intimating to HR, whenever relevant, the names of employees who have availed maternity leave.

# Resignation and Exit Process

The Supervisor must accept the resignation, specify the last working day of the employee, and forward it to KFSL HR.

KFSL HR intimates Karvy Corporate HR of the resignation.

In cases where an employee named in a whistleblower report resigns, our practice would be to accept the resignation but not relieve the employee until the investigation is complete.

KSBL HR sends a clearance form to the employee, who obtains the relevant clearances and sends it back to KSBL HR on his/her last working day. Prior to the employeeís separation, an exit interview needs to be conducted and feedback documented.

In the case of employees up to Manager Level, the exit interview has to be conducted by at least a VP level resource and KSBL HR. For employees above the Manager level, the exit interview is to be conducted by the CEO and KSBL HR.

HR gets gratuity claim forms filled by the separated employee (in case eligible) and sends the same along with the other separation documents to the HO-HR team for Full and Final settlement processing of the employees.

Karvy Corporate HR dispatches the settlement amount, the settlement details, and the relieving letter to the employee, subject to receipt of the completed clearance form.

File the exit interview form, with the interviewerís comments, resignation letter, and clearance form in the Personal Folder.

We would like to align our policy guidelines with employee needs as well as those of the organisation. Therefore, KFSL may change these policies at any time. This Manual is therefore designed to allow updates (deletions and additions) as and when the management of KFSL deems it necessary for the general benefit of the Employees and the Company.

As we move ahead, there will be changes that may need to be reflected in this manual. When such revisions occur, the Custodians will receive these updates along with directions to whether to replace a page in a particular policy or simply replace the entire policy within a section.

# Interview Guidelines

It is the responsibility of the interviewer to brief the candidate on the current role available, a brief background of the organization, the culture prevalent in the organization, and the location at which the role will be based.

# Basic Interviewing Guidelines:

- Do not make the candidate wait for more than 15 minutes.
- Be punctual and start the interview on time.
- Be presentable, greet the candidate, and ask for his well-being.
- Begin by talking about things of common interest to help break the ice.
- Ask open-ended questions and let the candidate do most of the talking.
- Do not intimidate the candidate even if his reply to your question is incorrect.
- Take notes during the interview.
- Explain the role in terms of expectations and responsibilities.
- Close by thanking the candidate for showing interest in our organization.
- Provide a realistic time frame for informing the candidate about the interview outcome.

For outstation candidates, a video conference (VC) should be preferred over a telephonic interview.

# Post-Interview Process:

The line manager and HR must fill up the interview assessment sheet (IAS) immediately after the interview while the experience is still fresh. This is a mandatory requirement for all interviews.

# Travel Reimbursement:

If a candidate travels from one city to another for an interview, the company will reimburse travel and incidentals. It is advised to schedule interviews so that candidates can return the same day. If not possible, accommodation will also be reimbursed. Eligibility for travel, boarding, and lodging will be according to the travel policy applicable to the candidate's proposed grade. Line managers are responsible for minimizing travel, and all travel must be pre-approved by the CEO and KFSL HR.

# Pre-employment Screening:

Once the line manager and HR agree on the candidate‚Äôs suitability, KFSL HR will conduct the following pre-employment checks:

- De-duplicate with the internal customer database (to check for any defaults).
- De-duplicate with the internal negative database (to check for any past interview history with the company).

Upon satisfactory results, KFSL HR will prepare a comparison sheet, which will be forwarded to the CEO for approval after recommendations from the line manager and interviewers. Once approved, the offered compensation and grade will be communicated to the candidate.

# Documents Required Before Offer Letter Release:

- Resume of the candidate.
- Interview assessment sheet filled by the line manager and HR.
- Clearance from the pre-employment checks.
- Photo ID proof.
- Last 2 months' salary slip.
- Copy of the last revision letter/appointment letter if no revision has been done.

# Joining Process

On acceptance of the offer letter, the prospective employee needs to communicate a tentative date of joining to HR. Once the employee joins the company, He/She is to be issued a formal appointment order. The appointment order can be issued by KFSL HR or Group Head HR.

# Notice Period Buy-Out

This option has to be exercised sparingly on a case-to-case basis. The line manager needs to keep in mind the level & criticality of the role before recommending for a buyout. The line manager needs to forward the requisition with the approximate amount to KFSL HR with a justification on the urgency of the recruit. KFSL HR will then get this approved by the CEO and Group Head HR. Desirably, the tenor of the buyout shall not exceed 30 days. This amount shall be reimbursed to the employee on production of proof of deduction and payment to the previous employer. However, in case the employee voluntarily terminates his/her employment within 12 months of joining, this amount will have to be recovered with his/her final settlement.

# Recruitment ‚Äì Associate Trainee Program

# Objective

To provide business with resources for specific short-term projects simultaneously providing exposure to students who have to undertake projects as a part of their curriculum.

On approval of this plan from the CEO, KFSL HR will identify the institutes which can be visited to fulfill the requirement of trainees.

# Interview Process

The following grid has to be adhered to while interviewing and finalizing an Associate Trainee:

The interviewer is expected to understand the capabilities and requirements of the trainee. The project details like the title, tenor, etc. should be shared during the interview discussion. The prospective trainee also needs to submit an introduction letter from his institute.

On successful completion of the training, the trainee is to be issued a letter of completion.

# 2.4 Hiring of Relatives

# Objective

To ensure that wherever employees related to each other are working in the organisation, they are not in a position to influence the jobs, performance or career progression of one another.

The company‚Äôs recruitment philosophy is hiring purely on merit. There is no restriction on hiring of relatives till such time it does not create a potential conflict of interest. In order to avoid potential conflict of interest and to reduce the possibility of favouritism or appearance of favouritism, the following guidelines must be followed:

- No one is assigned to a position where he/she has the opportunity to check, process, review, approve, audit or otherwise affect the work of the other related employee.
- No one is assigned to a position where he/she can influence the salary progress or promotion of the related employee.

In case any employee knows of a situation that appears to be an opportunity for one employee to show favouritism to his/her relative, he/she should contact the KFSL HR.

Example of relatives, for the sake of understanding is Parents / In-laws, Spouse, Children, Siblings etc. However, the list is not limited to relations defined above.

# Process

The HR department maintains data on related employees and updates it on a monthly basis. This list is to be reviewed by HR/Compliance on a quarterly basis.

All new hires must declare in their joining kit, if they have any relatives working with the Karvy Group to the best of their knowledge.

# 3.0 Probation and Confirmation

# Objective

To provide for a time frame to the organisation to evaluate the ‚Äúperformance and culture fit‚Äù factor vis-√†-vis the internal set standards. This also gives the individual time to understand his/her compatibility with the organisation.

# Scope

All new joinees at all levels will join on probation for a period of six months from their date of joining.

# Process

Step 1. (D-30) On completion of five months HR will send the necessary confirmation appraisal form to the supervisor.

# Performance Appraisal Process

1. Step 2: Within 10 days of receipt of the confirmation appraisal form, the supervisor should have a formal discussion with the appraisee. This discussion should revolve around the appraisee‚Äôs performance on KRA for the specific period, any limitations he/she has in executing his/her duties, etc.
2. Step 3: Post the personal discussion, the supervisor and the appraisee should arrive at a consensus on the performance during the last five months. In case they are not able to arrive at a consensus, the matter has to be referred to the skip level supervisor and HR. The decision of the skip level supervisor and HR shall be final.
3. Step 4: Based on the discussion, the supervisor needs to inform HR either on confirmation of services or extension of probation for the appraisee. Extension can be granted for a span of 1 to 3 months depending on the discussion of the supervisor, skip level manager, and HR. In case of extension of probation, the supervisor should share a performance improvement plan with the appraisee along with defined timelines for the achievement of the same. Whichever is the case, probation extension and confirmations have to be finally approved by the CEO.
4. Step 5: Confirmation/probation extension letter has to be issued to the appraisee. In case a probation extension letter is issued, it has to be accompanied with a copy of the performance improvement plan. The performance improvement plan has to be drafted by the line manager.
5. Step 6: (Only for probation extension cases) There has to be a fortnightly discussion on the appraisee‚Äôs progress on the performance improvement plan. Steps 1 to 5 have to be repeated while nearing the completion of the extended probation period. In case the employee under consideration does not scale up on performance parameters, the employee‚Äôs services can be terminated post discussion and approval of the immediate line manager, division/region/vertical head, CEO, and KFSL HR.

# Notice Period

Objective: To protect the interest of the organization during separation of employees.

Scope: All employees on rolls of the company.

# Notice Period Plan

|Level|On Probation|On Confirmation|
|---|---|---|
|Associate and Senior Associate|Nil|7 Days|
|Officer to Manager|15 Days|30 Days|
|Sr. Manager & above|30 Days|60 Days|

The company reserves the right to not accept compensation in lieu of notice period and make the employee serve partial or entire notice period. However, in the event an employee‚Äôs services are terminated for fraud, theft, or withholding of information or for any other form of misconduct, notice period will not be payable.

# Objective

To allow employees the benefit of an annual vacation for rest and relaxation.

# Eligibility

All permanent employees on the rolls of the company are eligible for LTA.

# Scope

For employees at all levels, LTA is fixed and is mentioned on the appointment letter/increment letter.

LTA entitlement can be claimed once in a financial year. However, for tax exemption purposes, LTA is exempt only twice in a block of 4 years as defined by the Government. If LTA is not claimed during the financial year, the same shall be carried forward to the next financial year.

As per Income Tax rules, actual train fare for AC first class/Economy air fare for the employee and dependent family members by the shortest route to the destination of travel is exempt from tax. Original train tickets for train travel or the original air ticket along with boarding pass for air travel must support the claim. No travel agent bill/photocopied tickets shall be accepted. In case of travel by road, the employee needs to attach the LTA Declaration Form along with his/her claim.

If a round journey between multiple locations is being undertaken, then tax exemption shall not be given on the entire trip, but only on the expenses incurred on traveling between two farthest locations (up and down) in the trip.

In case the place of travel is not connected by train/air and is undertaken by road, an amount equivalent to AC first class fare for the distance of the journey by shortest route is reimbursable on the basis that the journey has been performed by rail. Original taxi bills shall be required as proof of travel in this case.

Employees need to avail a minimum of 3 working days leave to claim LTA. All LTA claims must be supported by the approved leave application and documents as mentioned in the policy.

# Process

LTA claims do not need the supervisor‚Äôs signature and should be sent directly to HR. The LTA claim should contain an Expense Claim along with the following supporting documents:

- If the journey is undertaken by air, then the original tickets along with boarding passes.
- If the journey is undertaken by railway, then the original train tickets.
- If the journey is undertaken by road, then the details need to be filled in a subscribed format, which is available with HR.

LTA claims shall not be processed if:

- Photocopies of bills/tickets are sent.
- Tickets are not sent with the claim form.
- The claim form is incomplete.
- Only a travel agent's bill without tickets is given.

# 5.9 Provident Fund Benefit Policy

# Objective

To comply with the statutory regulations governing employee provident fund.

# Eligibility

The benefit of Provident Fund is extended to all employees from the date of joining their services with the company under the Employee Provident Fund & Misc. Provisions Act, 1952.

The rate of contribution is as given below:

- Employer‚Äôs contribution: 12% of Basic salary per month
- Employee‚Äôs contribution: 12% of Basic salary per month

The contribution of both the employer and employee are operated through the monthly payroll. The monthly PF contribution for all employees of the company is deposited with the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner.

An employee may increase his/her contribution under the Voluntary Provident Fund to a maximum of 20% of the Basic salary. This is an internally set limit, though there is no limit set by the act. In such a case, the concerned employee must inform the HR department about his/her decision to increase the contribution. This change can be effected only at the beginning of a new financial year.

The employer‚Äôs contribution remains fixed at 12% of Basic Salary per month.

# 5.10 Gratuity Benefit Policy

# Objective

To comply with the statutory regulations governing employee gratuity.

# Eligibility

The benefit of Gratuity is extended to all employees from the date of joining their services with the company under the Gratuity Act 1972.

The amount of gratuity payable is 15 days salary for every year of completed service in the company calculated on the basis of 26 days a month on the last basic salary drawn immediately preceding the date when the employee becomes entitled for gratuity under the scheme.

No Gratuity is payable if on the date of leaving the service the employee has not completed 1700 days of continuous service. However, in cases where termination of service is caused due to retrenchment, superannuation, death, physical disability of the employee, or transfer to any other associate/group company and the company to which he is transferred does not agree to take over the responsibility for payment of gratuity, the qualifying period of five years is not necessary for determining the eligibility for gratuity.

No Gratuity is payable if the services of an employee are terminated due to disciplinary action or if any action inquiry or legal suit is pending against the employee at the time of his leaving the service with the company. If an employee dies while in the services of the company, the amount of Gratuity payable in such an event is made payable to his/her spouse or, if there is no spouse, to his dependent children or other dependants.

# Performance Management Process

# Objective

- To provide a framework for systematic planning of performance objectives at the beginning of the year.
- To ensure congruence between individual objectives & organizational goals.
- To identify the gaps in performance for the purpose of development.

# Scope

All employees on rolls of the company will be eligible to participate in the performance management process; however, employees who have joined on or before the last day of October will be eligible for the financial increment arising out of this exercise in the same appraisal year.

# Process

The appraisal year is defined as the financial year i.e. April to March.

The process commences with a performance planning/goal setting exercise in which the Key Result Areas (KRAs) for all individuals are defined at the beginning of the year through a discussion between the employee and supervisor. The onus to set the KRAs for new joiners is on the new joinee and the supervisor. The KRAs should be submitted to KFSL HR duly approved by the CEO latest by 30 days after joining.

# Time Lines

The performance review has to be done quarterly, at the end of the financial year all the quarterly ratings are to be collated which helps in arriving at an annual rating for the individual.

1. At the end of the quarter, the employee has to fill in his achievements against the agreed KRAs. He/She also needs to allocate a score to the achievement based on the rating sheet below.
2. The employee will also define weightage (%) for every KRA. The sum total of all weights should be 100.
3. Appraisal discussion with supervisor: during the appraisal discussion between the supervisor and the employee, the supervisor will review the ratings provided by the employee and the relative weights allocated to individual KRAs.
4. The supervisor can alter the ratings/weights if he/she deems it fit.
5. The supervisor will then identify areas for improvement for the employee based on the discussion which have to be documented in the form.
6. Once there is consensus on the rating, the form has to be signed by the employee and the supervisor. (The employee can take a copy of the signed form for his records)
7. Post the rating by the supervisor, the same has to be reviewed by the skip level manager and subsequently by the CEO for manager level and above and division/region/vertical head.

# Types of Leaves:

# Privilege Leave

All employees are entitled to a maximum of 21 days of such leave in a calendar year. The entitlement for new joinees will be pro-rated depending on their date of joining. The 21 days of privilege leave is inclusive of 7 days of mandatory leave. All employees are required to avail of mandatory leave (7 days) once in the leave year.

For calculation of mandatory leave, paid holidays falling within the leave period will be counted as part of the leave.

To ensure that all employees avail their mandatory leave during the calendar year, it is recommended that all employees submit a tentative mandatory leave schedule to their Supervisors at the beginning of the year. The Supervisors then ensure that employees avail their leave in a staggered fashion throughout the year, without bunching up the leave either at the beginning or at the end of the year.

# Sick Leave

Sick leaves can be granted at the discretion of the supervisor, KSFL HR, and CEO. The immediate supervisor can approve up to 3 days of continuous leave. Any sick leave beyond 3 days at a stretch has to be approved by the CEO. Such leave application will have to be supported by adequate proof.

# Maternity Leave for Female Employees

Wherever applicable, maternity leave shall be governed by the provisions of the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961. This will apply to cases where an employee adopts a child also.

No employee will be entitled to Maternity Leave unless she has worked in the company for a period not less than eighty days in the twelve months preceding the date of her expected delivery. An employee will be entitled to twelve weeks maternity leave with full pay.

All reporting managers are responsible for intimating to HR, whenever relevant, the names of employees who have availed maternity leave.

# Resignation and Exit Process

The Supervisor must accept the resignation, specify the last working day of the employee, and forward it to KFSL HR.

KFSL HR intimates Karvy Corporate HR of the resignation.

In cases where an employee named in a whistleblower report resigns, our practice would be to accept the resignation but not relieve the employee until the investigation is complete.

KSBL HR sends a clearance form to the employee, who obtains the relevant clearances and sends it back to KSBL HR on his/her last working day. Prior to the employee‚Äôs separation, an exit interview needs to be conducted and feedback documented.

In the case of employees up to Manager Level, the exit interview has to be conducted by at least a VP level resource and KSBL HR. For employees above the Manager level, the exit interview is to be conducted by the CEO and KSBL HR.

HR gets gratuity claim forms filled by the separated employee (in case eligible) and sends the same along with the other separation documents to the HO-HR team for Full and Final settlement processing of the employees.

Karvy Corporate HR dispatches the settlement amount, the settlement details, and the relieving letter to the employee, subject to receipt of the completed clearance form.

File the exit interview form, with the interviewer‚Äôs comments, resignation letter, and clearance form in the Personal Folder.

We would like to align our policy guidelines with employee needs as well as those of the organisation. Therefore, KFSL may change these policies at any time. This Manual is therefore designed to allow updates (deletions and additions) as and when the management of KFSL deems it necessary for the general benefit of the Employees and the Company.

As we move ahead, there will be changes that may need to be reflected in this manual. When such revisions occur, the Custodians will receive these updates along with directions to whether to replace a page in a particular policy or simply replace the entire policy within a section.

|Officer| |
|Assistant Manager| |
|Manager / Senior Manager| |
|Assistant Vice President| |
|Vice President| |

Note: Immediate line managers, skip level managers, employees at an AVP level & above, and employees in the HR department are not eligible for any such reward.

- Empanelled Recruitment Consultants: KFSL HR will maintain a list of empanelled recruitment consultants. If required skill sets are not available within the organization, the requirement can be floated to recruitment consultants.

# Interview Guidelines

It is the responsibility of the interviewer to brief the candidate on the current role available, a brief background of the organization, the culture prevalent in the organization, and the location at which the role will be based.

# Basic Interviewing Guidelines:

- Do not make the candidate wait for more than 15 minutes.
- Be punctual and start the interview on time.
- Be presentable, greet the candidate, and ask for his well-being.
- Begin by talking about things of common interest to help break the ice.
- Ask open-ended questions and let the candidate do most of the talking.
- Do not intimidate the candidate even if his reply to your question is incorrect.
- Take notes during the interview.
- Explain the role in terms of expectations and responsibilities.
- Close by thanking the candidate for showing interest in our organization.
- Provide a realistic time frame for informing the candidate about the interview outcome.

For outstation candidates, a video conference (VC) should be preferred over a telephonic interview.

# Post-Interview Process:

The line manager and HR must fill up the interview assessment sheet (IAS) immediately after the interview while the experience is still fresh. This is a mandatory requirement for all interviews.

# Travel Reimbursement:

If a candidate travels from one city to another for an interview, the company will reimburse travel and incidentals. It is advised to schedule interviews so that candidates can return the same day. If not possible, accommodation will also be reimbursed. Eligibility for travel, boarding, and lodging will be according to the travel policy applicable to the candidate's proposed grade. Line managers are responsible for minimizing travel, and all travel must be pre-approved by the CEO and KFSL HR.

# Pre-employment Screening:

Once the line manager and HR agree on the candidateís suitability, KFSL HR will conduct the following pre-employment checks:

- De-duplicate with the internal customer database (to check for any defaults).
- De-duplicate with the internal negative database (to check for any past interview history with the company).

Upon satisfactory results, KFSL HR will prepare a comparison sheet, which will be forwarded to the CEO for approval after recommendations from the line manager and interviewers. Once approved, the offered compensation and grade will be communicated to the candidate.

# Documents Required Before Offer Letter Release:

- Resume of the candidate.
- Interview assessment sheet filled by the line manager and HR.
- Clearance from the pre-employment checks.
- Photo ID proof.
- Last 2 months' salary slip.
- Copy of the last revision letter/appointment letter if no revision has been done.

# Joining Process

On acceptance of the offer letter, the prospective employee needs to communicate a tentative date of joining to HR. Once the employee joins the company, He/She is to be issued a formal appointment order. The appointment order can be issued by KFSL HR or Group Head HR.

# Notice Period Buy-Out

This option has to be exercised sparingly on a case-to-case basis. The line manager needs to keep in mind the level & criticality of the role before recommending for a buyout. The line manager needs to forward the requisition with the approximate amount to KFSL HR with a justification on the urgency of the recruit. KFSL HR will then get this approved by the CEO and Group Head HR. Desirably, the tenor of the buyout shall not exceed 30 days. This amount shall be reimbursed to the employee on production of proof of deduction and payment to the previous employer. However, in case the employee voluntarily terminates his/her employment within 12 months of joining, this amount will have to be recovered with his/her final settlement.

# Recruitment ñ Associate Trainee Program

# Objective

To provide business with resources for specific short-term projects simultaneously providing exposure to students who have to undertake projects as a part of their curriculum.

# 2.4 Hiring of Relatives

# Objective

To ensure that wherever employees related to each other are working in the organisation, they are not in a position to influence the jobs, performance or career progression of one another.

The companyís recruitment philosophy is hiring purely on merit. There is no restriction on hiring of relatives till such time it does not create a potential conflict of interest. In order to avoid potential conflict of interest and to reduce the possibility of favouritism or appearance of favouritism, the following guidelines must be followed:

- No one is assigned to a position where he/she has the opportunity to check, process, review, approve, audit or otherwise affect the work of the other related employee.
- No one is assigned to a position where he/she can influence the salary progress or promotion of the related employee.

In case any employee knows of a situation that appears to be an opportunity for one employee to show favouritism to his/her relative, he/she should contact the KFSL HR.

Example of relatives, for the sake of understanding is Parents / In-laws, Spouse, Children, Siblings etc. However, the list is not limited to relations defined above.

# Process

The HR department maintains data on related employees and updates it on a monthly basis. This list is to be reviewed by HR/Compliance on a quarterly basis.

All new hires must declare in their joining kit, if they have any relatives working with the Karvy Group to the best of their knowledge.

# 3.0 Probation and Confirmation

# Objective

To provide for a time frame to the organisation to evaluate the ìperformance and culture fitî factor vis-‡-vis the internal set standards. This also gives the individual time to understand his/her compatibility with the organisation.

# Scope

All new joinees at all levels will join on probation for a period of six months from their date of joining.

# Process

Step 1. (D-30) On completion of five months HR will send the necessary confirmation appraisal form to the supervisor.

# Performance Appraisal Process

1. Step 2: Within 10 days of receipt of the confirmation appraisal form, the supervisor should have a formal discussion with the appraisee. This discussion should revolve around the appraiseeís performance on KRA for the specific period, any limitations he/she has in executing his/her duties, etc.
2. Step 3: Post the personal discussion, the supervisor and the appraisee should arrive at a consensus on the performance during the last five months. In case they are not able to arrive at a consensus, the matter has to be referred to the skip level supervisor and HR. The decision of the skip level supervisor and HR shall be final.
3. Step 4: Based on the discussion, the supervisor needs to inform HR either on confirmation of services or extension of probation for the appraisee. Extension can be granted for a span of 1 to 3 months depending on the discussion of the supervisor, skip level manager, and HR. In case of extension of probation, the supervisor should share a performance improvement plan with the appraisee along with defined timelines for the achievement of the same. Whichever is the case, probation extension and confirmations have to be finally approved by the CEO.
4. Step 5: Confirmation/probation extension letter has to be issued to the appraisee. In case a probation extension letter is issued, it has to be accompanied with a copy of the performance improvement plan. The performance improvement plan has to be drafted by the line manager.
5. Step 6: (Only for probation extension cases) There has to be a fortnightly discussion on the appraiseeís progress on the performance improvement plan. Steps 1 to 5 have to be repeated while nearing the completion of the extended probation period. In case the employee under consideration does not scale up on performance parameters, the employeeís services can be terminated post discussion and approval of the immediate line manager, division/region/vertical head, CEO, and KFSL HR.

# Notice Period

Objective: To protect the interest of the organization during separation of employees.

Scope: All employees on rolls of the company.

# Notice Period Plan

|Level|On Probation|On Confirmation|
|---|---|---|
|Associate and Senior Associate|Nil|7 Days|
|Officer to Manager|15 Days|30 Days|
|Sr. Manager & above|30 Days|60 Days|

The company reserves the right to not accept compensation in lieu of notice period and make the employee serve partial or entire notice period. However, in the event an employeeís services are terminated for fraud, theft, or withholding of information or for any other form of misconduct, notice period will not be payable.

# 5.0 Compensation & Benefits

# 5.1 Leave Travel Assistance Policy

# Objective

To allow employees the benefit of an annual vacation for rest and relaxation.

# Eligibility

All permanent employees on the rolls of the company are eligible for LTA.

# Scope

For employees at all levels, LTA is fixed and is mentioned on the appointment letter/increment letter.

LTA entitlement can be claimed once in a financial year. However, for tax exemption purposes, LTA is exempt only twice in a block of 4 years as defined by the Government. If LTA is not claimed during the financial year, the same shall be carried forward to the next financial year.

As per Income Tax rules, actual train fare for AC first class/Economy air fare for the employee and dependent family members by the shortest route to the destination of travel is exempt from tax. Original train tickets for train travel or the original air ticket along with boarding pass for air travel must support the claim. No travel agent bill/photocopied tickets shall be accepted. In case of travel by road, the employee needs to attach the LTA Declaration Form along with his/her claim.

If a round journey between multiple locations is being undertaken, then tax exemption shall not be given on the entire trip, but only on the expenses incurred on traveling between two farthest locations (up and down) in the trip.

In case the place of travel is not connected by train/air and is undertaken by road, an amount equivalent to AC first class fare for the distance of the journey by shortest route is reimbursable on the basis that the journey has been performed by rail. Original taxi bills shall be required as proof of travel in this case.

Employees need to avail a minimum of 3 working days leave to claim LTA. All LTA claims must be supported by the approved leave application and documents as mentioned in the policy.

# Process

LTA claims do not need the supervisorís signature and should be sent directly to HR. The LTA claim should contain an Expense Claim along with the following supporting documents:

- If the journey is undertaken by air, then the original tickets along with boarding passes.
- If the journey is undertaken by railway, then the original train tickets.
- If the journey is undertaken by road, then the details need to be filled in a subscribed format, which is available with HR.

LTA claims shall not be processed if:

- Photocopies of bills/tickets are sent.
- Tickets are not sent with the claim form.
- The claim form is incomplete.
- Only a travel agent's bill without tickets is given.

# 5.9 Provident Fund Benefit Policy

# Objective

To comply with the statutory regulations governing employee provident fund.

# Eligibility

The benefit of Provident Fund is extended to all employees from the date of joining their services with the company under the Employee Provident Fund & Misc. Provisions Act, 1952.

The rate of contribution is as given below:

- Employerís contribution: 12% of Basic salary per month
- Employeeís contribution: 12% of Basic salary per month

The contribution of both the employer and employee are operated through the monthly payroll. The monthly PF contribution for all employees of the company is deposited with the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner.

An employee may increase his/her contribution under the Voluntary Provident Fund to a maximum of 20% of the Basic salary. This is an internally set limit, though there is no limit set by the act. In such a case, the concerned employee must inform the HR department about his/her decision to increase the contribution. This change can be effected only at the beginning of a new financial year.

The employerís contribution remains fixed at 12% of Basic Salary per month.

# 5.10 Gratuity Benefit Policy

# Objective

To comply with the statutory regulations governing employee gratuity.

# Eligibility

The benefit of Gratuity is extended to all employees from the date of joining their services with the company under the Gratuity Act 1972.

The amount of gratuity payable is 15 days salary for every year of completed service in the company calculated on the basis of 26 days a month on the last basic salary drawn immediately preceding the date when the employee becomes entitled for gratuity under the scheme.

No Gratuity is payable if on the date of leaving the service the employee has not completed 1700 days of continuous service. However, in cases where termination of service is caused due to retrenchment, superannuation, death, physical disability of the employee, or transfer to any other associate/group company and the company to which he is transferred does not agree to take over the responsibility for payment of gratuity, the qualifying period of five years is not necessary for determining the eligibility for gratuity.

No Gratuity is payable if the services of an employee are terminated due to disciplinary action or if any action inquiry or legal suit is pending against the employee at the time of his leaving the service with the company. If an employee dies while in the services of the company, the amount of Gratuity payable in such an event is made payable to his/her spouse or, if there is no spouse, to his dependent children or other dependants.

# Performance Management Process

# Objective

- To provide a framework for systematic planning of performance objectives at the beginning of the year.
- To ensure congruence between individual objectives & organizational goals.
- To identify the gaps in performance for the purpose of development.

# Scope

All employees on rolls of the company will be eligible to participate in the performance management process; however, employees who have joined on or before the last day of October will be eligible for the financial increment arising out of this exercise in the same appraisal year.

# Process

The appraisal year is defined as the financial year i.e. April to March.

The process commences with a performance planning/goal setting exercise in which the Key Result Areas (KRAs) for all individuals are defined at the beginning of the year through a discussion between the employee and supervisor. The onus to set the KRAs for new joiners is on the new joinee and the supervisor. The KRAs should be submitted to KFSL HR duly approved by the CEO latest by 30 days after joining.

# Time Lines

The performance review has to be done quarterly, at the end of the financial year all the quarterly ratings are to be collated which helps in arriving at an annual rating for the individual.

1. At the end of the quarter, the employee has to fill in his achievements against the agreed KRAs. He/She also needs to allocate a score to the achievement based on the rating sheet below.
2. The employee will also define weightage (%) for every KRA. The sum total of all weights should be 100.
3. Appraisal discussion with supervisor: during the appraisal discussion between the supervisor and the employee, the supervisor will review the ratings provided by the employee and the relative weights allocated to individual KRAs.
4. The supervisor can alter the ratings/weights if he/she deems it fit.
5. The supervisor will then identify areas for improvement for the employee based on the discussion which have to be documented in the form.
6. Once there is consensus on the rating, the form has to be signed by the employee and the supervisor. (The employee can take a copy of the signed form for his records)
7. Post the rating by the supervisor, the same has to be reviewed by the skip level manager and subsequently by the CEO for manager level and above and division/region/vertical head.

# 7.0 Leave Policy

# Objective

To define leave entitlement for all employees.

# Eligibility

All employees on the rolls of the company are covered by the leave policy.

# Scope

Entitlement for leave is prorated and shall commence from the day an employee joins the Company.

# Types of Leaves:

# Privilege Leave

All employees are entitled to a maximum of 21 days of such leave in a calendar year. The entitlement for new joinees will be pro-rated depending on their date of joining. The 21 days of privilege leave is inclusive of 7 days of mandatory leave. All employees are required to avail of mandatory leave (7 days) once in the leave year.

For calculation of mandatory leave, paid holidays falling within the leave period will be counted as part of the leave.

To ensure that all employees avail their mandatory leave during the calendar year, it is recommended that all employees submit a tentative mandatory leave schedule to their Supervisors at the beginning of the year. The Supervisors then ensure that employees avail their leave in a staggered fashion throughout the year, without bunching up the leave either at the beginning or at the end of the year.

# Sick Leave

Sick leaves can be granted at the discretion of the supervisor, KSFL HR, and CEO. The immediate supervisor can approve up to 3 days of continuous leave. Any sick leave beyond 3 days at a stretch has to be approved by the CEO. Such leave application will have to be supported by adequate proof.

# Maternity Leave for Female Employees

Wherever applicable, maternity leave shall be governed by the provisions of the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961. This will apply to cases where an employee adopts a child also.

No employee will be entitled to Maternity Leave unless she has worked in the company for a period not less than eighty days in the twelve months preceding the date of her expected delivery. An employee will be entitled to twelve weeks maternity leave with full pay.

All reporting managers are responsible for intimating to HR, whenever relevant, the names of employees who have availed maternity leave.

# Resignation and Exit Process

The Supervisor must accept the resignation, specify the last working day of the employee, and forward it to KFSL HR.

KFSL HR intimates Karvy Corporate HR of the resignation.

In cases where an employee named in a whistleblower report resigns, our practice would be to accept the resignation but not relieve the employee until the investigation is complete.

KSBL HR sends a clearance form to the employee, who obtains the relevant clearances and sends it back to KSBL HR on his/her last working day. Prior to the employeeís separation, an exit interview needs to be conducted and feedback documented.

In the case of employees up to Manager Level, the exit interview has to be conducted by at least a VP level resource and KSBL HR. For employees above the Manager level, the exit interview is to be conducted by the CEO and KSBL HR.

HR gets gratuity claim forms filled by the separated employee (in case eligible) and sends the same along with the other separation documents to the HO-HR team for Full and Final settlement processing of the employees.

Karvy Corporate HR dispatches the settlement amount, the settlement details, and the relieving letter to the employee, subject to receipt of the completed clearance form.

File the exit interview form, with the interviewerís comments, resignation letter, and clearance form in the Personal Folder.

We would like to align our policy guidelines with employee needs as well as those of the organisation. Therefore, KFSL may change these policies at any time. This Manual is therefore designed to allow updates (deletions and additions) as and when the management of KFSL deems it necessary for the general benefit of the Employees and the Company.

As we move ahead, there will be changes that may need to be reflected in this manual. When such revisions occur, the Custodians will receive these updates along with directions to whether to replace a page in a particular policy or simply replace the entire policy within a section.

# Interview Guidelines

It is the responsibility of the interviewer to brief the candidate on the current role available, a brief background of the organization, the culture prevalent in the organization, and the location at which the role will be based.

# Basic Interviewing Guidelines:

- Do not make the candidate wait for more than 15 minutes.
- Be punctual and start the interview on time.
- Be presentable, greet the candidate, and ask for his well-being.
- Begin by talking about things of common interest to help break the ice.
- Ask open-ended questions and let the candidate do most of the talking.
- Do not intimidate the candidate even if his reply to your question is incorrect.
- Take notes during the interview.
- Explain the role in terms of expectations and responsibilities.
- Close by thanking the candidate for showing interest in our organization.
- Provide a realistic time frame for informing the candidate about the interview outcome.

For outstation candidates, a video conference (VC) should be preferred over a telephonic interview.

# Post-Interview Process:

The line manager and HR must fill up the interview assessment sheet (IAS) immediately after the interview while the experience is still fresh. This is a mandatory requirement for all interviews.

# Travel Reimbursement:

If a candidate travels from one city to another for an interview, the company will reimburse travel and incidentals. It is advised to schedule interviews so that candidates can return the same day.

# Joining Process

On acceptance of the offer letter, the prospective employee needs to communicate a tentative date of joining to HR. Once the employee joins the company, He/She is to be issued a formal appointment order. The appointment order can be issued by KFSL HR or Group Head HR.

# Notice Period Buy-Out

This option has to be exercised sparingly on a case-to-case basis. The line manager needs to keep in mind the level & criticality of the role before recommending for a buyout. The line manager needs to forward the requisition with the approximate amount to KFSL HR with a justification on the urgency of the recruit. KFSL HR will then get this approved by the CEO and Group Head HR. Desirably, the tenor of the buyout shall not exceed 30 days. This amount shall be reimbursed to the employee on production of proof of deduction and payment to the previous employer. However, in case the employee voluntarily terminates his/her employment within 12 months of joining, this amount will have to be recovered with his/her final settlement.

# Recruitment – Associate Trainee Program

# 2.4 Hiring of Relatives

# Objective

To ensure that wherever employees related to each other are working in the organisation, they are not in a position to influence the jobs, performance or career progression of one another.

The company’s recruitment philosophy is hiring purely on merit. There is no restriction on hiring of relatives till such time it does not create a potential conflict of interest. In order to avoid potential conflict of interest and to reduce the possibility of favouritism or appearance of favouritism, the following guidelines must be followed:

- No one is assigned to a position where he/she has the opportunity to check, process, review, approve, audit or otherwise affect the work of the other related employee.
- No one is assigned to a position where he/she can influence the salary progress or promotion of the related employee.

In case any employee knows of a situation that appears to be an opportunity for one employee to show favouritism to his/her relative, he/she should contact the KFSL HR.

Example of relatives, for the sake of understanding is Parents / In-laws, Spouse, Children, Siblings etc. However, the list is not limited to relations defined above.

# Process

The HR department maintains data on related employees and updates it on a monthly basis. This list is to be reviewed by HR/Compliance on a quarterly basis.

All new hires must declare in their joining kit, if they have any relatives working with the Karvy Group to the best of their knowledge.

# 3.0 Probation and Confirmation

# Objective

To provide for a time frame to the organisation to evaluate the “performance and culture fit” factor vis-à-vis the internal set standards. This also gives the individual time to understand his/her compatibility with the organisation.

# Scope

All new joinees at all levels will join on probation for a period of six months from their date of joining.

# Process

Step 1. (D-30) On completion of five months HR will send the necessary confirmation appraisal form to the supervisor.

# Performance Appraisal Process

1. Step 2: Within 10 days of receipt of the confirmation appraisal form, the supervisor should have a formal discussion with the appraisee. This discussion should revolve around the appraisee’s performance on KRA for the specific period, any limitations he/she has in executing his/her duties, etc.
2. Step 3: Post the personal discussion, the supervisor and the appraisee should arrive at a consensus on the performance during the last five months. In case they are not able to arrive at a consensus, the matter has to be referred to the skip level supervisor and HR. The decision of the skip level supervisor and HR shall be final.
3. Step 4: Based on the discussion, the supervisor needs to inform HR either on confirmation of services or extension of probation for the appraisee. Extension can be granted for a span of 1 to 3 months depending on the discussion of the supervisor, skip level manager, and HR. In case of extension of probation, the supervisor should share a performance improvement plan with the appraisee along with defined timelines for the achievement of the same. Whichever is the case, probation extension and confirmations have to be finally approved by the CEO.
4. Step 5: Confirmation/probation extension letter has to be issued to the appraisee. In case a probation extension letter is issued, it has to be accompanied with a copy of the performance improvement plan. The performance improvement plan has to be drafted by the line manager.
5. Step 6: (Only for probation extension cases) There has to be a fortnightly discussion on the appraisee’s progress on the performance improvement plan. Steps 1 to 5 have to be repeated while nearing the completion of the extended probation period. In case the employee under consideration does not scale up on performance parameters, the employee’s services can be terminated post discussion and approval of the immediate line manager, division/region/vertical head, CEO, and KFSL HR.

# Notice Period

Objective: To protect the interest of the organization during separation of employees.

Scope: All employees on rolls of the company.

# Notice Period Plan

|Level|On Probation|On Confirmation|
|---|---|---|
|Associate and Senior Associate|Nil|7 Days|
|Officer to Manager|15 Days|30 Days|
|Sr. Manager & above|30 Days|60 Days|

The company reserves the right to not accept compensation in lieu of notice period and make the employee serve partial or entire notice period. However, in the event an employee’s services are terminated for fraud, theft, or withholding of information or for any other form of misconduct, notice period will not be payable.

# 5.1 Leave Travel Assistance Policy

# Objective

To allow employees the benefit of an annual vacation for rest and relaxation.

# Eligibility

All permanent employees on the rolls of the company are eligible for LTA.

# Scope

For employees at all levels, LTA is fixed and is mentioned on the appointment letter/increment letter.

LTA entitlement can be claimed once in a financial year. However, for tax exemption purposes, LTA is exempt only twice in a block of 4 years as defined by the Government. If LTA is not claimed during the financial year, the same shall be carried forward to the next financial year.

As per Income Tax rules, actual train fare for AC first class/Economy air fare for the employee and dependent family members by the shortest route to the destination of travel is exempt from tax. Original train tickets for train travel or the original air ticket along with boarding pass for air travel must support the claim. No travel agent bill/photocopied tickets shall be accepted. In case of travel by road, the employee needs to attach the LTA Declaration Form along with his/her claim.

If a round journey between multiple locations is being undertaken, then tax exemption shall not be given on the entire trip, but only on the expenses incurred on traveling between two farthest locations (up and down) in the trip.

In case the place of travel is not connected by train/air and is undertaken by road, an amount equivalent to AC first class fare for the distance of the journey by shortest route is reimbursable on the basis that the journey has been performed by rail. Original taxi bills shall be required as proof of travel in this case.

Employees need to avail a minimum of 3 working days leave to claim LTA. All LTA claims must be supported by the approved leave application and documents as mentioned in the policy.

# Process

LTA claims do not need the supervisor’s signature and should be sent directly to HR. The LTA claim should contain an Expense Claim along with the following supporting documents:

- If the journey is undertaken by air, then the original tickets along with boarding passes.
- If the journey is undertaken by railway, then the original train tickets.
- If the journey is undertaken by road, then the details need to be filled in a subscribed format, which is available with HR.

LTA claims shall not be processed if:

- Photocopies of bills/tickets are sent.
- Tickets are not sent with the claim form.
- The claim form is incomplete.
- Only a travel agent's bill without tickets is given.

# 5.9 Provident Fund Benefit Policy

# Objective

To comply with the statutory regulations governing employee provident fund.

# Eligibility

The benefit of Provident Fund is extended to all employees from the date of joining their services with the company under the Employee Provident Fund & Misc. Provisions Act, 1952.

The rate of contribution is as given below:

- Employer’s contribution: 12% of Basic salary per month
- Employee’s contribution: 12% of Basic salary per month

The contribution of both the employer and employee are operated through the monthly payroll. The monthly PF contribution for all employees of the company is deposited with the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner.

An employee may increase his/her contribution under the Voluntary Provident Fund to a maximum of 20% of the Basic salary. This is an internally set limit, though there is no limit set by the act. In such a case, the concerned employee must inform the HR department about his/her decision to increase the contribution. This change can be effected only at the beginning of a new financial year.

The employer’s contribution remains fixed at 12% of Basic Salary per month.

# 5.10 Gratuity Benefit Policy

# Objective

To comply with the statutory regulations governing employee gratuity.

# Eligibility

The benefit of Gratuity is extended to all employees from the date of joining their services with the company under the Gratuity Act 1972.

The amount of gratuity payable is 15 days salary for every year of completed service in the company calculated on the basis of 26 days a month on the last basic salary drawn immediately preceding the date when the employee becomes entitled for gratuity under the scheme.

No Gratuity is payable if on the date of leaving the service the employee has not completed 1700 days of continuous service. However, in cases where termination of service is caused due to retrenchment, superannuation, death, physical disability of the employee, or transfer to any other associate/group company and the company to which he is transferred does not agree to take over the responsibility for payment of gratuity, the qualifying period of five years is not necessary for determining the eligibility for gratuity.

No Gratuity is payable if the services of an employee are terminated due to disciplinary action or if any action inquiry or legal suit is pending against the employee at the time of his leaving the service with the company. If an employee dies while in the services of the company, the amount of Gratuity payable in such an event is made payable to his/her spouse or, if there is no spouse, to his dependent children or other dependants.

The process commences with a performance planning/goal setting exercise in which the Key Result Areas (KRAs) for all individuals are defined at the beginning of the year through a discussion between the employee and supervisor. The onus to set the KRAs for new joiners is on the new joinee and the supervisor. The KRAs should be submitted to KFSL HR duly approved by the CEO latest by 30 days after joining.

# Time Lines

The performance review has to be done quarterly, at the end of the financial year all the quarterly ratings are to be collated which helps in arriving at an annual rating for the individual.

1. At the end of the quarter, the employee has to fill in his achievements against the agreed KRAs. He/She also needs to allocate a score to the achievement based on the rating sheet below.
2. The employee will also define weightage (%) for every KRA. The sum total of all weights should be 100.
3. Appraisal discussion with supervisor: during the appraisal discussion between the supervisor and the employee, the supervisor will review the ratings provided by the employee and the relative weights allocated to individual KRAs.
4. The supervisor can alter the ratings/weights if he/she deems it fit.
5. The supervisor will then identify areas for improvement for the employee based on the discussion which have to be documented in the form.
6. Once there is consensus on the rating, the form has to be signed by the employee and the supervisor. (The employee can take a copy of the signed form for his records)
7. Post the rating by the supervisor, the same has to be reviewed by the skip level manager and subsequently by the CEO for manager level and above and division/region/vertical head.

# Karvy Financial Services Ltd

# 7.0 Leave Policy

# Objective

To define leave entitlement for all employees.

# Eligibility

All employees on the rolls of the company are covered by the leave policy.

# Scope

Entitlement for leave is prorated and shall commence from the day an employee joins the Company.

# Types of Leaves:

# Privilege Leave

All employees are entitled to a maximum of 21 days of such leave in a calendar year. The entitlement for new joinees will be pro-rated depending on their date of joining. The 21 days of privilege leave is inclusive of 7 days of mandatory leave. All employees are required to avail of mandatory leave (7 days) once in the leave year.

For calculation of mandatory leave, paid holidays falling within the leave period will be counted as part of the leave.

To ensure that all employees avail their mandatory leave during the calendar year, it is recommended that all employees submit a tentative mandatory leave schedule to their Supervisors at the beginning of the year. The Supervisors then ensure that employees avail their leave in a staggered fashion throughout the year, without bunching up the leave either at the beginning or at the end of the year.

# Sick Leave

Sick leaves can be granted at the discretion of the supervisor, KSFL HR, and CEO. The immediate supervisor can approve up to 3 days of continuous leave. Any sick leave beyond 3 days at a stretch has to be approved by the CEO. Such leave application will have to be supported by adequate proof.

# Maternity Leave for Female Employees

Wherever applicable, maternity leave shall be governed by the provisions of the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961. This will apply to cases where an employee adopts a child also.

No employee will be entitled to Maternity Leave unless she has worked in the company for a period not less than eighty days in the twelve months preceding the date of her expected delivery. An employee will be entitled to twelve weeks maternity leave with full pay.

All reporting managers are responsible for intimating to HR, whenever relevant, the names of employees who have availed maternity leave.

# Resignation and Exit Process

The Supervisor must accept the resignation, specify the last working day of the employee, and forward it to KFSL HR.

KFSL HR intimates Karvy Corporate HR of the resignation.

In cases where an employee named in a whistleblower report resigns, our practice would be to accept the resignation but not relieve the employee until the investigation is complete.

KSBL HR sends a clearance form to the employee, who obtains the relevant clearances and sends it back to KSBL HR on his/her last working day. Prior to the employee’s separation, an exit interview needs to be conducted and feedback documented.

In the case of employees up to Manager Level, the exit interview has to be conducted by at least a VP level resource and KSBL HR. For employees above the Manager level, the exit interview is to be conducted by the CEO and KSBL HR.

HR gets gratuity claim forms filled by the separated employee (in case eligible) and sends the same along with the other separation documents to the HO-HR team for Full and Final settlement processing of the employees.

Karvy Corporate HR dispatches the settlement amount, the settlement details, and the relieving letter to the employee, subject to receipt of the completed clearance form.

File the exit interview form, with the interviewer’s comments, resignation letter, and clearance form in the Personal Folder.

We would like to align our policy guidelines with employee needs as well as those of the organisation. Therefore, KFSL may change these policies at any time. This Manual is therefore designed to allow updates (deletions and additions) as and when the management of KFSL deems it necessary for the general benefit of the Employees and the Company.

As we move ahead, there will be changes that may need to be reflected in this manual. When such revisions occur, the Custodians will receive these updates along with directions to whether to replace a page in a particular policy or simply replace the entire policy within a section.

# Interview Guidelines

It is the responsibility of the interviewer to brief the candidate on the current role available, a brief background of the organization, the culture prevalent in the organization, and the location at which the role will be based.

# Basic Interviewing Guidelines:

- Do not make the candidate wait for more than 15 minutes.
- Be punctual and start the interview on time.
- Be presentable, greet the candidate, and ask for his well-being.
- Begin by talking about things of common interest to help break the ice.
- Ask open-ended questions and let the candidate do most of the talking.
- Do not intimidate the candidate even if his reply to your question is incorrect.
- Take notes during the interview.
- Explain the role in terms of expectations and responsibilities.
- Close by thanking the candidate for showing interest in our organization.
- Provide a realistic time frame for informing the candidate about the interview outcome.

For outstation candidates, a video conference (VC) should be preferred over a telephonic interview.

# Post-Interview Process:

The line manager and HR must fill up the interview assessment sheet (IAS) immediately after the interview while the experience is still fresh. This is a mandatory requirement for all interviews.

# Travel Reimbursement:

If a candidate travels from one city to another for an interview, the company will reimburse travel and incidentals. It is advised to schedule interviews so that candidates can return the same day. If not possible, accommodation will also be reimbursed. Eligibility for travel, boarding, and lodging will be according to the travel policy applicable to the candidate's proposed grade. Line managers are responsible for minimizing travel, and all travel must be pre-approved by the CEO and KFSL HR.

# Pre-employment Screening:

Once the line manager and HR agree on the candidate’s suitability, KFSL HR will conduct the following pre-employment checks:

- De-duplicate with the internal customer database (to check for any defaults).
- De-duplicate with the internal negative database (to check for any past interview history with the company).

Upon satisfactory results, KFSL HR will prepare a comparison sheet, which will be forwarded to the CEO for approval after recommendations from the line manager and interviewers. Once approved, the offered compensation and grade will be communicated to the candidate.

# Documents Required Before Offer Letter Release:

- Resume of the candidate.
- Interview assessment sheet filled by the line manager and HR.
- Clearance from the pre-employment checks.
- Photo ID proof.
- Last 2 months' salary slip.
- Copy of the last revision letter/appointment letter if no revision has been done.

# Joining Process

On acceptance of the offer letter, the prospective employee needs to communicate a tentative date of joining to HR. Once the employee joins the company, He/She is to be issued a formal appointment order. The appointment order can be issued by KFSL HR or Group Head HR.

# Notice Period Buy-Out

This option has to be exercised sparingly on a case-to-case basis. The line manager needs to keep in mind the level & criticality of the role before recommending for a buyout. The line manager needs to forward the requisition with the approximate amount to KFSL HR with a justification on the urgency of the recruit. KFSL HR will then get this approved by the CEO and Group Head HR. Desirably, the tenor of the buyout shall not exceed 30 days. This amount shall be reimbursed to the employee on production of proof of deduction and payment to the previous employer. However, in case the employee voluntarily terminates his/her employment within 12 months of joining, this amount will have to be recovered with his/her final settlement.

# Recruitment – Associate Trainee Program

# Objective

To provide business with resources for specific short-term projects simultaneously providing exposure to students who have to undertake projects as a part of their curriculum.

# Scope

All trainees hired.

# Process

Identification and grading of management institutes has to be an ongoing exercise. Based on this exercise, KFSL shall embark on identification of institutes from where associate trainees can be hired.

The plan should contain the following:

- Project guide
- Title of the project
- Department in which the project will be undertaken
- Stipend payable (if any)
- Date of start and tenure of the project

On approval of this plan from the CEO, KFSL HR will identify the institutes which can be visited to fulfill the requirement of trainees.

# Interview Process

The following grid has to be adhered to while interviewing and finalizing an Associate Trainee:

- Tier 1 & 2: CEO and KFSL HR
- Tier 3: VP level vertical head and KFSL HR

The interviewer is expected to understand the capabilities and requirements of the trainee. The project details like the title, tenor, etc. should be shared during the interview discussion. The prospective trainee also needs to submit an introduction letter from his institute.

On successful completion of the training, the trainee is to be issued a letter of completion.

# 2.4 Hiring of Relatives

# Objective

To ensure that wherever employees related to each other are working in the organisation, they are not in a position to influence the jobs, performance or career progression of one another.

The company’s recruitment philosophy is hiring purely on merit. There is no restriction on hiring of relatives till such time it does not create a potential conflict of interest. In order to avoid potential conflict of interest and to reduce the possibility of favouritism or appearance of favouritism, the following guidelines must be followed:

- No one is assigned to a position where he/she has the opportunity to check, process, review, approve, audit or otherwise affect the work of the other related employee.
- No one is assigned to a position where he/she can influence the salary progress or promotion of the related employee.

In case any employee knows of a situation that appears to be an opportunity for one employee to show favouritism to his/her relative, he/she should contact the KFSL HR.

Example of relatives, for the sake of understanding is Parents / In-laws, Spouse, Children, Siblings etc. However, the list is not limited to relations defined above.

# Process

The HR department maintains data on related employees and updates it on a monthly basis. This list is to be reviewed by HR/Compliance on a quarterly basis.

All new hires must declare in their joining kit, if they have any relatives working with the Karvy Group to the best of their knowledge.

# 3.0 Probation and Confirmation

# Objective

To provide for a time frame to the organisation to evaluate the “performance and culture fit” factor vis-à-vis the internal set standards. This also gives the individual time to understand his/her compatibility with the organisation.

# Scope

All new joinees at all levels will join on probation for a period of six months from their date of joining.

# Process

Step 1. (D-30) On completion of five months HR will send the necessary confirmation appraisal form to the supervisor.

# Performance Appraisal Process

1. Step 2: Within 10 days of receipt of the confirmation appraisal form, the supervisor should have a formal discussion with the appraisee. This discussion should revolve around the appraisee’s performance on KRA for the specific period, any limitations he/she has in executing his/her duties, etc.
2. Step 3: Post the personal discussion, the supervisor and the appraisee should arrive at a consensus on the performance during the last five months. In case they are not able to arrive at a consensus, the matter has to be referred to the skip level supervisor and HR. The decision of the skip level supervisor and HR shall be final.
3. Step 4: Based on the discussion, the supervisor needs to inform HR either on confirmation of services or extension of probation for the appraisee. Extension can be granted for a span of 1 to 3 months depending on the discussion of the supervisor, skip level manager, and HR. In case of extension of probation, the supervisor should share a performance improvement plan with the appraisee along with defined timelines for the achievement of the same. Whichever is the case, probation extension and confirmations have to be finally approved by the CEO.
4. Step 5: Confirmation/probation extension letter has to be issued to the appraisee. In case a probation extension letter is issued, it has to be accompanied with a copy of the performance improvement plan. The performance improvement plan has to be drafted by the line manager.
5. Step 6: (Only for probation extension cases) There has to be a fortnightly discussion on the appraisee’s progress on the performance improvement plan. Steps 1 to 5 have to be repeated while nearing the completion of the extended probation period. In case the employee under consideration does not scale up on performance parameters, the employee’s services can be terminated post discussion and approval of the immediate line manager, division/region/vertical head, CEO, and KFSL HR.

# Notice Period

Objective: To protect the interest of the organization during separation of employees.

Scope: All employees on rolls of the company.

# Notice Period Plan

|Level|On Probation|On Confirmation|
|---|---|---|
|Associate and Senior Associate|Nil|7 Days|
|Officer to Manager|15 Days|30 Days|
|Sr. Manager & above|30 Days|60 Days|

The company reserves the right to not accept compensation in lieu of notice period and make the employee serve partial or entire notice period. However, in the event an employee’s services are terminated for fraud, theft, or withholding of information or for any other form of misconduct, notice period will not be payable.

# 5.1 Leave Travel Assistance Policy

# Objective

To allow employees the benefit of an annual vacation for rest and relaxation.

# Eligibility

All permanent employees on the rolls of the company are eligible for LTA.

# Scope

For employees at all levels, LTA is fixed and is mentioned on the appointment letter/increment letter.

LTA entitlement can be claimed once in a financial year. However, for tax exemption purposes, LTA is exempt only twice in a block of 4 years as defined by the Government. If LTA is not claimed during the financial year, the same shall be carried forward to the next financial year.

As per Income Tax rules, actual train fare for AC first class/Economy air fare for the employee and dependent family members by the shortest route to the destination of travel is exempt from tax. Original train tickets for train travel or the original air ticket along with boarding pass for air travel must support the claim. No travel agent bill/photocopied tickets shall be accepted. In case of travel by road, the employee needs to attach the LTA Declaration Form along with his/her claim.

If a round journey between multiple locations is being undertaken, then tax exemption shall not be given on the entire trip, but only on the expenses incurred on traveling between two farthest locations (up and down) in the trip.

In case the place of travel is not connected by train/air and is undertaken by road, an amount equivalent to AC first class fare for the distance of the journey by shortest route is reimbursable on the basis that the journey has been performed by rail. Original taxi bills shall be required as proof of travel in this case.

Employees need to avail a minimum of 3 working days leave to claim LTA. All LTA claims must be supported by the approved leave application and documents as mentioned in the policy.

# Process

LTA claims do not need the supervisor’s signature and should be sent directly to HR. The LTA claim should contain an Expense Claim along with the following supporting documents:

- If the journey is undertaken by air, then the original tickets along with boarding passes.
- If the journey is undertaken by railway, then the original train tickets.
- If the journey is undertaken by road, then the details need to be filled in a subscribed format, which is available with HR.

LTA claims shall not be processed if:

- Photocopies of bills/tickets are sent.
- Tickets are not sent with the claim form.
- The claim form is incomplete.
- Only a travel agent's bill without tickets is given.

# 5.9 Provident Fund Benefit Policy

# Objective

To comply with the statutory regulations governing employee provident fund.

# Eligibility

The benefit of Provident Fund is extended to all employees from the date of joining their services with the company under the Employee Provident Fund & Misc. Provisions Act, 1952.

The rate of contribution is as given below:

- Employer’s contribution: 12% of Basic salary per month
- Employee’s contribution: 12% of Basic salary per month

The contribution of both the employer and employee are operated through the monthly payroll. The monthly PF contribution for all employees of the company is deposited with the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner.

An employee may increase his/her contribution under the Voluntary Provident Fund to a maximum of 20% of the Basic salary. This is an internally set limit, though there is no limit set by the act. In such a case, the concerned employee must inform the HR department about his/her decision to increase the contribution. This change can be effected only at the beginning of a new financial year.

The employer’s contribution remains fixed at 12% of Basic Salary per month.

# 5.10 Gratuity Benefit Policy

# Objective

To comply with the statutory regulations governing employee gratuity.

# Eligibility

The benefit of Gratuity is extended to all employees from the date of joining their services with the company under the Gratuity Act 1972.

The amount of gratuity payable is 15 days salary for every year of completed service in the company calculated on the basis of 26 days a month on the last basic salary drawn immediately preceding the date when the employee becomes entitled for gratuity under the scheme.

No Gratuity is payable if on the date of leaving the service the employee has not completed 1700 days of continuous service. However, in cases where termination of service is caused due to retrenchment, superannuation, death, physical disability of the employee, or transfer to any other associate/group company and the company to which he is transferred does not agree to take over the responsibility for payment of gratuity, the qualifying period of five years is not necessary for determining the eligibility for gratuity.

No Gratuity is payable if the services of an employee are terminated due to disciplinary action or if any action inquiry or legal suit is pending against the employee at the time of his leaving the service with the company. If an employee dies while in the services of the company, the amount of Gratuity payable in such an event is made payable to his/her spouse or, if there is no spouse, to his dependent children or other dependants.

# Performance Management Process

# Objective

- To provide a framework for systematic planning of performance objectives at the beginning of the year.
- To ensure congruence between individual objectives & organizational goals.
- To identify the gaps in performance for the purpose of development.

# Scope

All employees on rolls of the company will be eligible to participate in the performance management process; however, employees who have joined on or before the last day of October will be eligible for the financial increment arising out of this exercise in the same appraisal year.

# Process

The appraisal year is defined as the financial year i.e. April to March.

The process commences with a performance planning/goal setting exercise in which the Key Result Areas (KRAs) for all individuals are defined at the beginning of the year through a discussion between the employee and supervisor. The onus to set the KRAs for new joiners is on the new joinee and the supervisor. The KRAs should be submitted to KFSL HR duly approved by the CEO latest by 30 days after joining.

# Time Lines

The performance review has to be done quarterly, at the end of the financial year all the quarterly ratings are to be collated which helps in arriving at an annual rating for the individual.

1. At the end of the quarter, the employee has to fill in his achievements against the agreed KRAs. He/She also needs to allocate a score to the achievement based on the rating sheet below.
2. The employee will also define weightage (%) for every KRA. The sum total of all weights should be 100.
3. Appraisal discussion with supervisor: during the appraisal discussion between the supervisor and the employee, the supervisor will review the ratings provided by the employee and the relative weights allocated to individual KRAs.
4. The supervisor can alter the ratings/weights if he/she deems it fit.
5. The supervisor will then identify areas for improvement for the employee based on the discussion which have to be documented in the form.
6. Once there is consensus on the rating, the form has to be signed by the employee and the supervisor. (The employee can take a copy of the signed form for his records)
7. Post the rating by the supervisor, the same has to be reviewed by the skip level manager and subsequently by the CEO for manager level and above and division/region/vertical head.

# Objective

To define leave entitlement for all employees.

# Eligibility

All employees on the rolls of the company are covered by the leave policy.

# Scope

Entitlement for leave is prorated and shall commence from the day an employee joins the Company.

# Types of Leaves:

# Privilege Leave

All employees are entitled to a maximum of 21 days of such leave in a calendar year. The entitlement for new joinees will be pro-rated depending on their date of joining. The 21 days of privilege leave is inclusive of 7 days of mandatory leave. All employees are required to avail of mandatory leave (7 days) once in the leave year.

For calculation of mandatory leave, paid holidays falling within the leave period will be counted as part of the leave.

To ensure that all employees avail their mandatory leave during the calendar year, it is recommended that all employees submit a tentative mandatory leave schedule to their Supervisors at the beginning of the year. The Supervisors then ensure that employees avail their leave in a staggered fashion throughout the year, without bunching up the leave either at the beginning or at the end of the year.

# Sick Leave

Sick leaves can be granted at the discretion of the supervisor, KSFL HR, and CEO. The immediate supervisor can approve up to 3 days of continuous leave. Any sick leave beyond 3 days at a stretch has to be approved by the CEO. Such leave application will have to be supported by adequate proof.

# Maternity Leave for Female Employees

Wherever applicable, maternity leave shall be governed by the provisions of the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961. This will apply to cases where an employee adopts a child also.

No employee will be entitled to Maternity Leave unless she has worked in the company for a period not less than eighty days in the twelve months preceding the date of her expected delivery. An employee will be entitled to twelve weeks maternity leave with full pay.

All reporting managers are responsible for intimating to HR, whenever relevant, the names of employees who have availed maternity leave.

# Relocation / Transfer Expenses

The Company will reimburse or organize relocation / transfer expenses on actual subjects to prior approval of vertical head and KFSL HR, CEO and Group Head HR.

Employees on transfer / relocation will be entitled to stay at a hotel / company guesthouse for a period of 1 week. Any extension for staying at the guesthouse / hotel will need the prior approval of the CEO and Group Head HR.

For employees who stay in a hotel, entitlements of the Domestic Travel Policy will apply. Prior to the relocation, the employee can make one trip along with his / her spouse, to finalize accommodation etc. In case school admission is required for children, up to two children may accompany the parents on the same visit. Entitlement for travel would be governed by the Domestic Travel Policy.

# Process

The employee should obtain at least three quotations from Packing & Forwarding Agents, which should be sent to Administration Department and Human Resources for approval. The quotations should include cost of freight for household goods and car, packing, forwarding, uploading/loading and insurance details. On receipt of the quotation HR/Admin will give an approval to one of the quotations.

The employee is expected to make the payment directly to the vendor, this would be reimbursed to the employee on production of actual bills.

After the transfer is affected, the employee is required to submit a reimbursement claim (for travel and hotel / guest house stay) to the HR Department who will approve and forward to the Accounts department for payment.

# Human Resource Policy Manual

# Resignation and Exit Process

The Supervisor must accept the resignation, specify the last working day of the employee, and forward it to KFSL HR.

KFSL HR intimates Karvy Corporate HR of the resignation.

In cases where an employee named in a whistleblower report resigns, our practice would be to accept the resignation but not relieve the employee until the investigation is complete.

KSBL HR sends a clearance form to the employee, who obtains the relevant clearances and sends it back to KSBL HR on his/her last working day. Prior to the employee’s separation, an exit interview needs to be conducted and feedback documented.

In the case of employees up to Manager Level, the exit interview has to be conducted by at least a VP level resource and KSBL HR. For employees above the Manager level, the exit interview is to be conducted by the CEO and KSBL HR.

HR gets gratuity claim forms filled by the separated employee (in case eligible) and sends the same along with the other separation documents to the HO-HR team for Full and Final settlement processing of the employees.

Karvy Corporate HR dispatches the settlement amount, the settlement details, and the relieving letter to the employee, subject to receipt of the completed clearance form.

File the exit interview form, with the interviewer’s comments, resignation letter, and clearance form in the Personal Folder.

We would like to align our policy guidelines with employee needs as well as those of the organisation. Therefore, KFSL may change these policies at any time. This Manual is therefore designed to allow updates (deletions and additions) as and when the management of KFSL deems it necessary for the general benefit of the Employees and the Company.

As we move ahead, there will be changes that may need to be reflected in this manual. When such revisions occur, the Custodians will receive these updates along with directions to whether to replace a page in a particular policy or simply replace the entire policy within a section.

# Interview Guidelines

It is the responsibility of the interviewer to brief the candidate on the current role available, a brief background of the organization, the culture prevalent in the organization, and the location at which the role will be based.

# Basic Interviewing Guidelines:

- Do not make the candidate wait for more than 15 minutes.
- Be punctual and start the interview on time.
- Be presentable, greet the candidate, and ask for his well-being.
- Begin by talking about things of common interest to help break the ice.
- Ask open-ended questions and let the candidate do most of the talking.
- Do not intimidate the candidate even if his reply to your question is incorrect.
- Take notes during the interview.
- Explain the role in terms of expectations and responsibilities.
- Close by thanking the candidate for showing interest in our organization.
- Provide a realistic time frame for informing the candidate about the interview outcome.

For outstation candidates, a video conference (VC) should be preferred over a telephonic interview.

# Post-Interview Process:

The line manager and HR must fill up the interview assessment sheet (IAS) immediately after the interview while the experience is still fresh. This is a mandatory requirement for all interviews.

# Travel Reimbursement:

If a candidate travels from one city to another for an interview, the company will reimburse travel and incidentals. It is advised to schedule interviews so that candidates can return the same day. If not possible, accommodation will also be reimbursed. Eligibility for travel, boarding, and lodging will be according to the travel policy applicable to the candidate's proposed grade. Line managers are responsible for minimizing travel, and all travel must be pre-approved by the CEO and KFSL HR.

# Pre-employment Screening:

Once the line manager and HR agree on the candidate’s suitability, KFSL HR will conduct the following pre-employment checks:

- De-duplicate with the internal customer database (to check for any defaults).
- De-duplicate with the internal negative database (to check for any past interview history with the company).

Upon satisfactory results, KFSL HR will prepare a comparison sheet, which will be forwarded to the CEO for approval after recommendations from the line manager and interviewers. Once approved, the offered compensation and grade will be communicated to the candidate.

# Documents Required Before Offer Letter Release:

- Resume of the candidate.
- Interview assessment sheet filled by the line manager and HR.
- Clearance from the pre-employment checks.
- Photo ID proof.
- Last 2 months' salary slip.
- Copy of the last revision letter/appointment letter if no revision has been done.

# Joining Process

On acceptance of the offer letter, the prospective employee needs to communicate a tentative date of joining to HR. Once the employee joins the company, He/She is to be issued a formal appointment order. The appointment order can be issued by KFSL HR or Group Head HR.

# Notice Period Buy-Out

This option has to be exercised sparingly on a case-to-case basis. The line manager needs to keep in mind the level & criticality of the role before recommending for a buyout. The line manager needs to forward the requisition with the approximate amount to KFSL HR with a justification on the urgency of the recruit. KFSL HR will then get this approved by the CEO and Group Head HR. Desirably, the tenor of the buyout shall not exceed 30 days. This amount shall be reimbursed to the employee on production of proof of deduction and payment to the previous employer. However, in case the employee voluntarily terminates his/her employment within 12 months of joining, this amount will have to be recovered with his/her final settlement.

# Recruitment – Associate Trainee Program

# Objective

To provide business with resources for specific short-term projects simultaneously providing exposure to students who have to undertake projects as a part of their curriculum.

# Scope

All trainees hired.

# Process

Identification and grading of management institutes has to be an ongoing exercise. Based on this exercise, KFSL shall embark on identification of institutes from where associate trainees can be hired.

The plan should contain the following:

- Project guide
- Title of the project
- Department in which the project will be undertaken
- Stipend payable (if any)
- Date of start and tenure of the project

On approval of this plan from the CEO, KFSL HR will identify the institutes which can be visited to fulfill the requirement of trainees.

# Interview Process

The following grid has to be adhered to while interviewing and finalizing an Associate Trainee:

- Tier 1 & 2: CEO and KFSL HR
- Tier 3: VP level vertical head and KFSL HR

The interviewer is expected to understand the capabilities and requirements of the trainee. The project details like the title, tenor, etc. should be shared during the interview discussion. The prospective trainee also needs to submit an introduction letter from his institute.

On successful completion of the training, the trainee is to be issued a letter of completion.

# 2.4 Hiring of Relatives

# Objective

To ensure that wherever employees related to each other are working in the organisation, they are not in a position to influence the jobs, performance or career progression of one another.

The company’s recruitment philosophy is hiring purely on merit. There is no restriction on hiring of relatives till such time it does not create a potential conflict of interest. In order to avoid potential conflict of interest and to reduce the possibility of favouritism or appearance of favouritism, the following guidelines must be followed:

- No one is assigned to a position where he/she has the opportunity to check, process, review, approve, audit or otherwise affect the work of the other related employee.
- No one is assigned to a position where he/she can influence the salary progress or promotion of the related employee.

In case any employee knows of a situation that appears to be an opportunity for one employee to show favouritism to his/her relative, he/she should contact the KFSL HR.

Example of relatives, for the sake of understanding is Parents / In-laws, Spouse, Children, Siblings etc. However, the list is not limited to relations defined above.

# Process

The HR department maintains data on related employees and updates it on a monthly basis. This list is to be reviewed by HR/Compliance on a quarterly basis.

All new hires must declare in their joining kit, if they have any relatives working with the Karvy Group to the best of their knowledge.

# 3.0 Probation and Confirmation

# Objective

To provide for a time frame to the organisation to evaluate the “performance and culture fit” factor vis-à-vis the internal set standards. This also gives the individual time to understand his/her compatibility with the organisation.

# Scope

All new joinees at all levels will join on probation for a period of six months from their date of joining.

# Process

Step 1. (D-30) On completion of five months HR will send the necessary confirmation appraisal form to the supervisor.

# Performance Appraisal Process

1. Step 2: Within 10 days of receipt of the confirmation appraisal form, the supervisor should have a formal discussion with the appraisee. This discussion should revolve around the appraisee’s performance on KRA for the specific period, any limitations he/she has in executing his/her duties, etc.
2. Step 3: Post the personal discussion, the supervisor and the appraisee should arrive at a consensus on the performance during the last five months. In case they are not able to arrive at a consensus, the matter has to be referred to the skip level supervisor and HR. The decision of the skip level supervisor and HR shall be final.
3. Step 4: Based on the discussion, the supervisor needs to inform HR either on confirmation of services or extension of probation for the appraisee. Extension can be granted for a span of 1 to 3 months depending on the discussion of the supervisor, skip level manager, and HR. In case of extension of probation, the supervisor should share a performance improvement plan with the appraisee along with defined timelines for the achievement of the same. Whichever is the case, probation extension and confirmations have to be finally approved by the CEO.
4. Step 5: Confirmation/probation extension letter has to be issued to the appraisee. In case a probation extension letter is issued, it has to be accompanied with a copy of the performance improvement plan. The performance improvement plan has to be drafted by the line manager.
5. Step 6: (Only for probation extension cases) There has to be a fortnightly discussion on the appraisee’s progress on the performance improvement plan. Steps 1 to 5 have to be repeated while nearing the completion of the extended probation period. In case the employee under consideration does not scale up on performance parameters, the employee’s services can be terminated post discussion and approval of the immediate line manager, division/region/vertical head, CEO, and KFSL HR.

# Objective

# Eligibility

All permanent employees on the rolls of the company are eligible for LTA.

# Scope

For employees at all levels, LTA is fixed and is mentioned on the appointment letter/increment letter.

LTA entitlement can be claimed once in a financial year. However, for tax exemption purposes, LTA is exempt only twice in a block of 4 years as defined by the Government. If LTA is not claimed during the financial year, the same shall be carried forward to the next financial year.

As per Income Tax rules, actual train fare for AC first class/Economy air fare for the employee and dependent family members by the shortest route to the destination of travel is exempt from tax. Original train tickets for train travel or the original air ticket along with boarding pass for air travel must support the claim. No travel agent bill/photocopied tickets shall be accepted. In case of travel by road, the employee needs to attach the LTA Declaration Form along with his/her claim.

If a round journey between multiple locations is being undertaken, then tax exemption shall not be given on the entire trip, but only on the expenses incurred on traveling between two farthest locations (up and down) in the trip.

In case the place of travel is not connected by train/air and is undertaken by road, an amount equivalent to AC first class fare for the distance of the journey by shortest route is reimbursable on the basis that the journey has been performed by rail. Original taxi bills shall be required as proof of travel in this case.

Employees need to avail a minimum of 3 working days leave to claim LTA. All LTA claims must be supported by the approved leave application and documents as mentioned in the policy.

# Process

LTA claims do not need the supervisor’s signature and should be sent directly to HR. The LTA claim should contain an Expense Claim along with the following supporting documents:

- If the journey is undertaken by air, then the original tickets along with boarding passes.
- If the journey is undertaken by railway, then the original train tickets.
- If the journey is undertaken by road, then the details need to be filled in a subscribed format, which is available with HR.

LTA claims shall not be processed if:

- Photocopies of bills/tickets are sent.
- Tickets are not sent with the claim form.
- The claim form is incomplete.
- Only a travel agent's bill without tickets is given.

# 5.9 Provident Fund Benefit Policy

# Objective

To comply with the statutory regulations governing employee provident fund.

# Eligibility

The benefit of Provident Fund is extended to all employees from the date of joining their services with the company under the Employee Provident Fund & Misc. Provisions Act, 1952.

The rate of contribution is as given below:

- Employer’s contribution: 12% of Basic salary per month
- Employee’s contribution: 12% of Basic salary per month

The contribution of both the employer and employee are operated through the monthly payroll. The monthly PF contribution for all employees of the company is deposited with the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner.

An employee may increase his/her contribution under the Voluntary Provident Fund to a maximum of 20% of the Basic salary. This is an internally set limit, though there is no limit set by the act. In such a case, the concerned employee must inform the HR department about his/her decision to increase the contribution. This change can be effected only at the beginning of a new financial year.

The employer’s contribution remains fixed at 12% of Basic Salary per month.

# 5.10 Gratuity Benefit Policy

# Objective

To comply with the statutory regulations governing employee gratuity.

# Eligibility

The benefit of Gratuity is extended to all employees from the date of joining their services with the company under the Gratuity Act 1972.

The amount of gratuity payable is 15 days salary for every year of completed service in the company calculated on the basis of 26 days a month on the last basic salary drawn immediately preceding the date when the employee becomes entitled for gratuity under the scheme.

No Gratuity is payable if on the date of leaving the service the employee has not completed 1700 days of continuous service. However, in cases where termination of service is caused due to retrenchment, superannuation, death, physical disability of the employee, or transfer to any other associate/group company and the company to which he is transferred does not agree to take over the responsibility for payment of gratuity, the qualifying period of five years is not necessary for determining the eligibility for gratuity.

No Gratuity is payable if the services of an employee are terminated due to disciplinary action or if any action inquiry or legal suit is pending against the employee at the time of his leaving the service with the company. If an employee dies while in the services of the company, the amount of Gratuity payable in such an event is made payable to his/her spouse or, if there is no spouse, to his dependent children or other dependants.

# Performance Management Process

# Objective

- To provide a framework for systematic planning of performance objectives at the beginning of the year.
- To ensure congruence between individual objectives & organizational goals.
- To identify the gaps in performance for the purpose of development.

# Scope

All employees on rolls of the company will be eligible to participate in the performance management process; however, employees who have joined on or before the last day of October will be eligible for the financial increment arising out of this exercise in the same appraisal year.

# Process

The appraisal year is defined as the financial year i.e. April to March.

The process commences with a performance planning/goal setting exercise in which the Key Result Areas (KRAs) for all individuals are defined at the beginning of the year through a discussion between the employee and supervisor. The onus to set the KRAs for new joiners is on the new joinee and the supervisor. The KRAs should be submitted to KFSL HR duly approved by the CEO latest by 30 days after joining.

# Time Lines

The performance review has to be done quarterly, at the end of the financial year all the quarterly ratings are to be collated which helps in arriving at an annual rating for the individual.

1. At the end of the quarter, the employee has to fill in his achievements against the agreed KRAs. He/She also needs to allocate a score to the achievement based on the rating sheet below.
2. The employee will also define weightage (%) for every KRA. The sum total of all weights should be 100.
3. Appraisal discussion with supervisor: during the appraisal discussion between the supervisor and the employee, the supervisor will review the ratings provided by the employee and the relative weights allocated to individual KRAs.
4. The supervisor can alter the ratings/weights if he/she deems it fit.
5. The supervisor will then identify areas for improvement for the employee based on the discussion which have to be documented in the form.
6. Once there is consensus on the rating, the form has to be signed by the employee and the supervisor. (The employee can take a copy of the signed form for his records)
7. Post the rating by the supervisor, the same has to be reviewed by the skip level manager and subsequently by the CEO for manager level and above and division/region/vertical head.

Sick leaves can be granted at the discretion of the supervisor, KSFL HR, and CEO. The immediate supervisor can approve up to 3 days of continuous leave. Any sick leave beyond 3 days at a stretch has to be approved by the CEO. Such leave application will have to be supported by adequate proof.

# Maternity Leave for Female Employees

Wherever applicable, maternity leave shall be governed by the provisions of the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961. This will apply to cases where an employee adopts a child also.

No employee will be entitled to Maternity Leave unless she has worked in the company for a period not less than eighty days in the twelve months preceding the date of her expected delivery. An employee will be entitled to twelve weeks maternity leave with full pay.

# Resignation and Exit Process

The Supervisor must accept the resignation, specify the last working day of the employee, and forward it to KFSL HR.

KFSL HR intimates Karvy Corporate HR of the resignation.

In cases where an employee named in a whistleblower report resigns, our practice would be to accept the resignation but not relieve the employee until the investigation is complete.

KSBL HR sends a clearance form to the employee, who obtains the relevant clearances and sends it back to KSBL HR on his/her last working day. Prior to the employee’s separation, an exit interview needs to be conducted and feedback documented.

In the case of employees up to Manager Level, the exit interview has to be conducted by at least a VP level resource and KSBL HR. For employees above the Manager level, the exit interview is to be conducted by the CEO and KSBL HR.

HR gets gratuity claim forms filled by the separated employee (in case eligible) and sends the same along with the other separation documents to the HO-HR team for Full and Final settlement processing of the employees.

Karvy Corporate HR dispatches the settlement amount, the settlement details, and the relieving letter to the employee, subject to receipt of the completed clearance form.

File the exit interview form, with the interviewer’s comments, resignation letter, and clearance form in the Personal Folder.

We would like to align our policy guidelines with employee needs as well as those of the organisation. Therefore, KFSL may change these policies at any time. This Manual is therefore designed to allow updates (deletions and additions) as and when the management of KFSL deems it necessary for the general benefit of the Employees and the Company.

As we move ahead, there will be changes that may need to be reflected in this manual. When such revisions occur, the Custodians will receive these updates along with directions to whether to replace a page in a particular policy or simply replace the entire policy within a section.

# Manpower Requirement Form (MRF)

All hiring requests have to be channeled through MRF. This helps track and reconcile the category of hiring under backfill or additional hire. The MRF must be sent to KFSL HR with pre-approval from the CEO.

# Sourcing of Candidates

Upon receipt of the MRF, KFSL HR can utilize the following sources as per the requirement:

- Job Portals: Job portals will be made available to the sourcing team, serving as a cost-effective source for hiring middle-level positions.
- Internal Referral: All hiring requirements will be published for employee information (exceptions may apply for confidentiality). Internal referrals will be incentivized as follows:

|Level|Amount (Gross of tax)|
|---|---|
|Associate/Senior Associate|In line with Karvy Group HR policy|
|Officer| |
|Assistant Manager| |
|Manager / Senior Manager| |
|Assistant Vice President| |
|Vice President| |

Note: Immediate line managers, skip level managers, employees at an AVP level & above, and employees in the HR department are not eligible for any such reward.

- Empanelled Recruitment Consultants: KFSL HR will maintain a list of empanelled recruitment consultants. If required skill sets are not available within the organization, the requirement can be floated to recruitment consultants.

# Empanelment Process

The process for empanelment of a new recruitment consultant is as follows:

- The Location line manager or KFSL HR can propose empanelment.
- This recommendation will be reviewed and approved by the CEO and Group Head HR.

# Human Resource Policy Manual

# Interview Guidelines

It is the responsibility of the interviewer to brief the candidate on the current role available, a brief background of the organization, the culture prevalent in the organization, and the location at which the role will be based.

# Basic Interviewing Guidelines:

- Do not make the candidate wait for more than 15 minutes.
- Be punctual and start the interview on time.
- Be presentable, greet the candidate, and ask for his well-being.
- Begin by talking about things of common interest to help break the ice.
- Ask open-ended questions and let the candidate do most of the talking.
- Do not intimidate the candidate even if his reply to your question is incorrect.
- Take notes during the interview.
- Explain the role in terms of expectations and responsibilities.
- Close by thanking the candidate for showing interest in our organization.
- Provide a realistic time frame for informing the candidate about the interview outcome.

For outstation candidates, a video conference (VC) should be preferred over a telephonic interview.

# Post-Interview Process:

The line manager and HR must fill up the interview assessment sheet (IAS) immediately after the interview while the experience is still fresh. This is a mandatory requirement for all interviews.

# Travel Reimbursement:

If a candidate travels from one city to another for an interview, the company will reimburse travel and incidentals. It is advised to schedule interviews so that candidates can return the same day. If not possible, accommodation will also be reimbursed. Eligibility for travel, boarding, and lodging will be according to the travel policy applicable to the candidate's proposed grade. Line managers are responsible for minimizing travel, and all travel must be pre-approved by the CEO and KFSL HR.

# Pre-employment Screening:

Once the line manager and HR agree on the candidate’s suitability, KFSL HR will conduct the following pre-employment checks:

- De-duplicate with the internal customer database (to check for any defaults).
- De-duplicate with the internal negative database (to check for any past interview history with the company).

Upon satisfactory results, KFSL HR will prepare a comparison sheet, which will be forwarded to the CEO for approval after recommendations from the line manager and interviewers. Once approved, the offered compensation and grade will be communicated to the candidate.

# Documents Required Before Offer Letter Release:

- Resume of the candidate.
- Interview assessment sheet filled by the line manager and HR.
- Clearance from the pre-employment checks.
- Photo ID proof.
- Last 2 months' salary slip.
- Copy of the last revision letter/appointment letter if no revision has been done.

# Joining Process

On acceptance of the offer letter, the prospective employee needs to communicate a tentative date of joining to HR. Once the employee joins the company, He/She is to be issued a formal appointment order. The appointment order can be issued by KFSL HR or Group Head HR.

# Notice Period Buy-Out

This option has to be exercised sparingly on a case-to-case basis. The line manager needs to keep in mind the level & criticality of the role before recommending for a buyout. The line manager needs to forward the requisition with the approximate amount to KFSL HR with a justification on the urgency of the recruit. KFSL HR will then get this approved by the CEO and Group Head HR. Desirably, the tenor of the buyout shall not exceed 30 days. This amount shall be reimbursed to the employee on production of proof of deduction and payment to the previous employer. However, in case the employee voluntarily terminates his/her employment within 12 months of joining, this amount will have to be recovered with his/her final settlement.

# Recruitment – Associate Trainee Program

# Process

Identification and grading of management institutes has to be an ongoing exercise. Based on this exercise, KFSL shall embark on identification of institutes from where associate trainees can be hired.

- Project guide
- Title of the project
- Department in which the project will be undertaken
- Stipend payable (if any)
- Date of start and tenure of the project

On approval of this plan from the CEO, KFSL HR will identify the institutes which can be visited to fulfill the requirement of trainees.

# 2.4 Hiring of Relatives

# Objective

To ensure that wherever employees related to each other are working in the organisation, they are not in a position to influence the jobs, performance or career progression of one another.

The company’s recruitment philosophy is hiring purely on merit. There is no restriction on hiring of relatives till such time it does not create a potential conflict of interest. In order to avoid potential conflict of interest and to reduce the possibility of favouritism or appearance of favouritism, the following guidelines must be followed:

- No one is assigned to a position where he/she has the opportunity to check, process, review, approve, audit or otherwise affect the work of the other related employee.
- No one is assigned to a position where he/she can influence the salary progress or promotion of the related employee.

In case any employee knows of a situation that appears to be an opportunity for one employee to show favouritism to his/her relative, he/she should contact the KFSL HR.

Example of relatives, for the sake of understanding is Parents / In-laws, Spouse, Children, Siblings etc. However, the list is not limited to relations defined above.

# Process

The HR department maintains data on related employees and updates it on a monthly basis. This list is to be reviewed by HR/Compliance on a quarterly basis.

All new hires must declare in their joining kit, if they have any relatives working with the Karvy Group to the best of their knowledge.

# 3.0 Probation and Confirmation

# Objective

To provide for a time frame to the organisation to evaluate the “performance and culture fit” factor vis-à-vis the internal set standards. This also gives the individual time to understand his/her compatibility with the organisation.

# Scope

All new joinees at all levels will join on probation for a period of six months from their date of joining.

# Process

Step 1. (D-30) On completion of five months HR will send the necessary confirmation appraisal form to the supervisor.

# Performance Appraisal Process

1. Step 2: Within 10 days of receipt of the confirmation appraisal form, the supervisor should have a formal discussion with the appraisee. This discussion should revolve around the appraisee’s performance on KRA for the specific period, any limitations he/she has in executing his/her duties, etc.
2. Step 3: Post the personal discussion, the supervisor and the appraisee should arrive at a consensus on the performance during the last five months. In case they are not able to arrive at a consensus, the matter has to be referred to the skip level supervisor and HR. The decision of the skip level supervisor and HR shall be final.
3. Step 4: Based on the discussion, the supervisor needs to inform HR either on confirmation of services or extension of probation for the appraisee. Extension can be granted for a span of 1 to 3 months depending on the discussion of the supervisor, skip level manager, and HR. In case of extension of probation, the supervisor should share a performance improvement plan with the appraisee along with defined timelines for the achievement of the same. Whichever is the case, probation extension and confirmations have to be finally approved by the CEO.
4. Step 5: Confirmation/probation extension letter has to be issued to the appraisee. In case a probation extension letter is issued, it has to be accompanied with a copy of the performance improvement plan. The performance improvement plan has to be drafted by the line manager.
5. Step 6: (Only for probation extension cases) There has to be a fortnightly discussion on the appraisee’s progress on the performance improvement plan. Steps 1 to 5 have to be repeated while nearing the completion of the extended probation period. In case the employee under consideration does not scale up on performance parameters, the employee’s services can be terminated post discussion and approval of the immediate line manager, division/region/vertical head, CEO, and KFSL HR.

# Objective

To allow employees the benefit of an annual vacation for rest and relaxation.

# Eligibility

All permanent employees on the rolls of the company are eligible for LTA.

# Scope

For employees at all levels, LTA is fixed and is mentioned on the appointment letter/increment letter.

LTA entitlement can be claimed once in a financial year. However, for tax exemption purposes, LTA is exempt only twice in a block of 4 years as defined by the Government. If LTA is not claimed during the financial year, the same shall be carried forward to the next financial year.

As per Income Tax rules, actual train fare for AC first class/Economy air fare for the employee and dependent family members by the shortest route to the destination of travel is exempt from tax. Original train tickets for train travel or the original air ticket along with boarding pass for air travel must support the claim. No travel agent bill/photocopied tickets shall be accepted. In case of travel by road, the employee needs to attach the LTA Declaration Form along with his/her claim.

In case the place of travel is not connected by train/air and is undertaken by road, an amount equivalent to AC first class fare for the distance of the journey by shortest route is reimbursable on the basis that the journey has been performed by rail. Original taxi bills shall be required as proof of travel in this case.

Employees need to avail a minimum of 3 working days leave to claim LTA. All LTA claims must be supported by the approved leave application and documents as mentioned in the policy.

# Process

LTA claims do not need the supervisor’s signature and should be sent directly to HR. The LTA claim should contain an Expense Claim along with the following supporting documents:

- If the journey is undertaken by air, then the original tickets along with boarding passes.
- If the journey is undertaken by railway, then the original train tickets.
- If the journey is undertaken by road, then the details need to be filled in a subscribed format, which is available with HR.

LTA claims shall not be processed if:

- Photocopies of bills/tickets are sent.
- Tickets are not sent with the claim form.
- The claim form is incomplete.
- Only a travel agent's bill without tickets is given.

# Objective

To comply with the statutory regulations governing employee provident fund.

# Eligibility

The benefit of Provident Fund is extended to all employees from the date of joining their services with the company under the Employee Provident Fund & Misc. Provisions Act, 1952.

The rate of contribution is as given below:

- Employer’s contribution: 12% of Basic salary per month
- Employee’s contribution: 12% of Basic salary per month

The contribution of both the employer and employee are operated through the monthly payroll. The monthly PF contribution for all employees of the company is deposited with the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner.

An employee may increase his/her contribution under the Voluntary Provident Fund to a maximum of 20% of the Basic salary. This is an internally set limit, though there is no limit set by the act. In such a case, the concerned employee must inform the HR department about his/her decision to increase the contribution. This change can be effected only at the beginning of a new financial year.

The employer’s contribution remains fixed at 12% of Basic Salary per month.

# 5.10 Gratuity Benefit Policy

# Objective

To comply with the statutory regulations governing employee gratuity.

# Eligibility

The benefit of Gratuity is extended to all employees from the date of joining their services with the company under the Gratuity Act 1972.

The amount of gratuity payable is 15 days salary for every year of completed service in the company calculated on the basis of 26 days a month on the last basic salary drawn immediately preceding the date when the employee becomes entitled for gratuity under the scheme.

No Gratuity is payable if on the date of leaving the service the employee has not completed 1700 days of continuous service. However, in cases where termination of service is caused due to retrenchment, superannuation, death, physical disability of the employee, or transfer to any other associate/group company and the company to which he is transferred does not agree to take over the responsibility for payment of gratuity, the qualifying period of five years is not necessary for determining the eligibility for gratuity.

No Gratuity is payable if the services of an employee are terminated due to disciplinary action or if any action inquiry or legal suit is pending against the employee at the time of his leaving the service with the company. If an employee dies while in the services of the company, the amount of Gratuity payable in such an event is made payable to his/her spouse or, if there is no spouse, to his dependent children or other dependants.

# Performance Management Process

# Objective

- To provide a framework for systematic planning of performance objectives at the beginning of the year.
- To ensure congruence between individual objectives & organizational goals.
- To identify the gaps in performance for the purpose of development.

# Scope

All employees on rolls of the company will be eligible to participate in the performance management process; however, employees who have joined on or before the last day of October will be eligible for the financial increment arising out of this exercise in the same appraisal year.

# Process

The appraisal year is defined as the financial year i.e. April to March.

The process commences with a performance planning/goal setting exercise in which the Key Result Areas (KRAs) for all individuals are defined at the beginning of the year through a discussion between the employee and supervisor. The onus to set the KRAs for new joiners is on the new joinee and the supervisor. The KRAs should be submitted to KFSL HR duly approved by the CEO latest by 30 days after joining.

# Time Lines

The performance review has to be done quarterly, at the end of the financial year all the quarterly ratings are to be collated which helps in arriving at an annual rating for the individual.

1. At the end of the quarter, the employee has to fill in his achievements against the agreed KRAs. He/She also needs to allocate a score to the achievement based on the rating sheet below.
2. The employee will also define weightage (%) for every KRA. The sum total of all weights should be 100.
3. Appraisal discussion with supervisor: during the appraisal discussion between the supervisor and the employee, the supervisor will review the ratings provided by the employee and the relative weights allocated to individual KRAs.
4. The supervisor can alter the ratings/weights if he/she deems it fit.
5. The supervisor will then identify areas for improvement for the employee based on the discussion which have to be documented in the form.
6. Once there is consensus on the rating, the form has to be signed by the employee and the supervisor. (The employee can take a copy of the signed form for his records)
7. Post the rating by the supervisor, the same has to be reviewed by the skip level manager and subsequently by the CEO for manager level and above and division/region/vertical head.

In such a case, the concerned employee must inform the HR department about his/her decision to increase the contribution. This change can be effected only at the beginning of a new financial year.

The employer’s contribution remains fixed at 12% of Basic Salary per month.

# 5.10 Gratuity Benefit Policy

# Objective

To comply with the statutory regulations governing employee gratuity.

# Eligibility

The benefit of Gratuity is extended to all employees from the date of joining their services with the company under the Gratuity Act 1972.

The amount of gratuity payable is 15 days salary for every year of completed service in the company calculated on the basis of 26 days a month on the last basic salary drawn immediately preceding the date when the employee becomes entitled for gratuity under the scheme.

No Gratuity is payable if on the date of leaving the service the employee has not completed 1700 days of continuous service. However, in cases where termination of service is caused due to retrenchment, superannuation, death, physical disability of the employee, or transfer to any other associate/group company and the company to which he is transferred does not agree to take over the responsibility for payment of gratuity, the qualifying period of five years is not necessary for determining the eligibility for gratuity.

No Gratuity is payable if the services of an employee are terminated due to disciplinary action or if any action inquiry or legal suit is pending against the employee at the time of his leaving the service with the company. If an employee dies while in the services of the company, the amount of Gratuity payable in such an event is made payable to his/her spouse or, if there is no spouse, to his dependent children or other dependants.

# Karvy Financial Services Ltd

# Performance Management Process

# Objective

- To provide a framework for systematic planning of performance objectives at the beginning of the year.
- To ensure congruence between individual objectives & organizational goals.
- To identify the gaps in performance for the purpose of development.

# Scope

All employees on rolls of the company will be eligible to participate in the performance management process; however, employees who have joined on or before the last day of October will be eligible for the financial increment arising out of this exercise in the same appraisal year.

# Process

The appraisal year is defined as the financial year i.e. April to March.

The process commences with a performance planning/goal setting exercise in which the Key Result Areas (KRAs) for all individuals are defined at the beginning of the year through a discussion between the employee and supervisor. The onus to set the KRAs for new joiners is on the new joinee and the supervisor. The KRAs should be submitted to KFSL HR duly approved by the CEO latest by 30 days after joining.

# Time Lines

The performance review has to be done quarterly, at the end of the financial year all the quarterly ratings are to be collated which helps in arriving at an annual rating for the individual.

1. At the end of the quarter, the employee has to fill in his achievements against the agreed KRAs. He/She also needs to allocate a score to the achievement based on the rating sheet below.
2. The employee will also define weightage (%) for every KRA. The sum total of all weights should be 100.
3. Appraisal discussion with supervisor: during the appraisal discussion between the supervisor and the employee, the supervisor will review the ratings provided by the employee and the relative weights allocated to individual KRAs.
4. The supervisor can alter the ratings/weights if he/she deems it fit.
5. The supervisor will then identify areas for improvement for the employee based on the discussion which have to be documented in the form.
6. Once there is consensus on the rating, the form has to be signed by the employee and the supervisor. (The employee can take a copy of the signed form for his records)
7. Post the rating by the supervisor, the same has to be reviewed by the skip level manager and subsequently by the CEO for manager level and above and division/region/vertical head.

# Resignation and Exit Process

The Supervisor must accept the resignation, specify the last working day of the employee, and forward it to KFSL HR.

KFSL HR intimates Karvy Corporate HR of the resignation.

In cases where an employee named in a whistleblower report resigns, our practice would be to accept the resignation but not relieve the employee until the investigation is complete.

KSBL HR sends a clearance form to the employee, who obtains the relevant clearances and sends it back to KSBL HR on his/her last working day. Prior to the employee’s separation, an exit interview needs to be conducted and feedback documented.

In the case of employees up to Manager Level, the exit interview has to be conducted by at least a VP level resource and KSBL HR. For employees above the Manager level, the exit interview is to be conducted by the CEO and KSBL HR.

HR gets gratuity claim forms filled by the separated employee (in case eligible) and sends the same along with the other separation documents to the HO-HR team for Full and Final settlement processing of the employees.

Karvy Corporate HR dispatches the settlement amount, the settlement details, and the relieving letter to the employee, subject to receipt of the completed clearance form.

File the exit interview form, with the interviewer’s comments, resignation letter, and clearance form in the Personal Folder.

We would like to align our policy guidelines with employee needs as well as those of the organisation. Therefore, KFSL may change these policies at any time. This Manual is therefore designed to allow updates (deletions and additions) as and when the management of KFSL deems it necessary for the general benefit of the Employees and the Company.

As we move ahead, there will be changes that may need to be reflected in this manual. When such revisions occur, the Custodians will receive these updates along with directions to whether to replace a page in a particular policy or simply replace the entire policy within a section.

# Interview Guidelines

It is the responsibility of the interviewer to brief the candidate on the current role available, a brief background of the organization, the culture prevalent in the organization, and the location at which the role will be based.

# Basic Interviewing Guidelines:

- Do not make the candidate wait for more than 15 minutes.
- Be punctual and start the interview on time.
- Be presentable, greet the candidate, and ask for his well-being.
- Begin by talking about things of common interest to help break the ice.
- Ask open-ended questions and let the candidate do most of the talking.
- Do not intimidate the candidate even if his reply to your question is incorrect.
- Take notes during the interview.
- Explain the role in terms of expectations and responsibilities.
- Close by thanking the candidate for showing interest in our organization.
- Provide a realistic time frame for informing the candidate about the interview outcome.

For outstation candidates, a video conference (VC) should be preferred over a telephonic interview.

# Post-Interview Process:

The line manager and HR must fill up the interview assessment sheet (IAS) immediately after the interview while the experience is still fresh. This is a mandatory requirement for all interviews.

# Travel Reimbursement:

If a candidate travels from one city to another for an interview, the company will reimburse travel and incidentals. It is advised to schedule interviews so that candidates can return the same day. If not possible, accommodation will also be reimbursed. Eligibility for travel, boarding, and lodging will be according to the travel policy applicable to the candidate's proposed grade. Line managers are responsible for minimizing travel, and all travel must be pre-approved by the CEO and KFSL HR.

# Pre-employment Screening:

Once the line manager and HR agree on the candidate’s suitability, KFSL HR will conduct the following pre-employment checks:

- De-duplicate with the internal customer database (to check for any defaults).
- De-duplicate with the internal negative database (to check for any past interview history with the company).

Upon satisfactory results, KFSL HR will prepare a comparison sheet, which will be forwarded to the CEO for approval after recommendations from the line manager and interviewers. Once approved, the offered compensation and grade will be communicated to the candidate.

# Documents Required Before Offer Letter Release:

- Resume of the candidate.
- Interview assessment sheet filled by the line manager and HR.
- Clearance from the pre-employment checks.
- Photo ID proof.
- Last 2 months' salary slip.
- Copy of the last revision letter/appointment letter if no revision has been done.

# Joining Process

On acceptance of the offer letter, the prospective employee needs to communicate a tentative date of joining to HR. Once the employee joins the company, He/She is to be issued a formal appointment order. The appointment order can be issued by KFSL HR or Group Head HR.

# Notice Period Buy-Out

This option has to be exercised sparingly on a case-to-case basis. The line manager needs to keep in mind the level & criticality of the role before recommending for a buyout. The line manager needs to forward the requisition with the approximate amount to KFSL HR with a justification on the urgency of the recruit. KFSL HR will then get this approved by the CEO and Group Head HR. Desirably, the tenor of the buyout shall not exceed 30 days. This amount shall be reimbursed to the employee on production of proof of deduction and payment to the previous employer. However, in case the employee voluntarily terminates his/her employment within 12 months of joining, this amount will have to be recovered with his/her final settlement.

# Recruitment – Associate Trainee Program

# Objective

To provide business with resources for specific short-term projects simultaneously providing exposure to students who have to undertake projects as a part of their curriculum.

- Project guide
- Title of the project

The following grid has to be adhered to while interviewing and finalizing an Associate Trainee:

- Tier 1 & 2: CEO and KFSL HR
- Tier 3: VP level vertical head and KFSL HR

The interviewer is expected to understand the capabilities and requirements of the trainee. The project details like the title, tenor, etc. should be shared during the interview discussion. The prospective trainee also needs to submit an introduction letter from his institute.

# 2.4 Hiring of Relatives

# Objective

To ensure that wherever employees related to each other are working in the organisation, they are not in a position to influence the jobs, performance or career progression of one another.

The company’s recruitment philosophy is hiring purely on merit. There is no restriction on hiring of relatives till such time it does not create a potential conflict of interest. In order to avoid potential conflict of interest and to reduce the possibility of favouritism or appearance of favouritism, the following guidelines must be followed:

- No one is assigned to a position where he/she has the opportunity to check, process, review, approve, audit or otherwise affect the work of the other related employee.
- No one is assigned to a position where he/she can influence the salary progress or promotion of the related employee.

In case any employee knows of a situation that appears to be an opportunity for one employee to show favouritism to his/her relative, he/she should contact the KFSL HR.

Example of relatives, for the sake of understanding is Parents / In-laws, Spouse, Children, Siblings etc. However, the list is not limited to relations defined above.

# Process

The HR department maintains data on related employees and updates it on a monthly basis. This list is to be reviewed by HR/Compliance on a quarterly basis.

All new hires must declare in their joining kit, if they have any relatives working with the Karvy Group to the best of their knowledge.

# 3.0 Probation and Confirmation

# Objective

To provide for a time frame to the organisation to evaluate the “performance and culture fit” factor vis-à-vis the internal set standards. This also gives the individual time to understand his/her compatibility with the organisation.

# Scope

All new joinees at all levels will join on probation for a period of six months from their date of joining.

# Process

Step 1. (D-30) On completion of five months HR will send the necessary confirmation appraisal form to the supervisor.

# Performance Appraisal Process

1. Step 2: Within 10 days of receipt of the confirmation appraisal form, the supervisor should have a formal discussion with the appraisee. This discussion should revolve around the appraisee’s performance on KRA for the specific period, any limitations he/she has in executing his/her duties, etc.
2. Step 3: Post the personal discussion, the supervisor and the appraisee should arrive at a consensus on the performance during the last five months. In case they are not able to arrive at a consensus, the matter has to be referred to the skip level supervisor and HR. The decision of the skip level supervisor and HR shall be final.
3. Step 4: Based on the discussion, the supervisor needs to inform HR either on confirmation of services or extension of probation for the appraisee. Extension can be granted for a span of 1 to 3 months depending on the discussion of the supervisor, skip level manager, and HR. In case of extension of probation, the supervisor should share a performance improvement plan with the appraisee along with defined timelines for the achievement of the same. Whichever is the case, probation extension and confirmations have to be finally approved by the CEO.
4. Step 5: Confirmation/probation extension letter has to be issued to the appraisee. In case a probation extension letter is issued, it has to be accompanied with a copy of the performance improvement plan. The performance improvement plan has to be drafted by the line manager.
5. Step 6: (Only for probation extension cases) There has to be a fortnightly discussion on the appraisee’s progress on the performance improvement plan. Steps 1 to 5 have to be repeated while nearing the completion of the extended probation period. In case the employee under consideration does not scale up on performance parameters, the employee’s services can be terminated post discussion and approval of the immediate line manager, division/region/vertical head, CEO, and KFSL HR.

# Notice Period

Objective: To protect the interest of the organization during separation of employees.

Scope: All employees on rolls of the company.

# Notice Period Plan

|Level|On Probation|On Confirmation|
|---|---|---|
|Associate and Senior Associate|Nil|7 Days|
|Officer to Manager|15 Days|30 Days|
|Sr. Manager & above|30 Days|60 Days|

The company reserves the right to not accept compensation in lieu of notice period and make the employee serve partial or entire notice period. However, in the event an employee’s services are terminated for fraud, theft, or withholding of information or for any other form of misconduct, notice period will not be payable.

# 5.1 Leave Travel Assistance Policy

# Objective

To allow employees the benefit of an annual vacation for rest and relaxation.

# Eligibility

All permanent employees on the rolls of the company are eligible for LTA.

# Scope

For employees at all levels, LTA is fixed and is mentioned on the appointment letter/increment letter.

LTA entitlement can be claimed once in a financial year. However, for tax exemption purposes, LTA is exempt only twice in a block of 4 years as defined by the Government. If LTA is not claimed during the financial year, the same shall be carried forward to the next financial year.

As per Income Tax rules, actual train fare for AC first class/Economy air fare for the employee and dependent family members by the shortest route to the destination of travel is exempt from tax. Original train tickets for train travel or the original air ticket along with boarding pass for air travel must support the claim. No travel agent bill/photocopied tickets shall be accepted. In case of travel by road, the employee needs to attach the LTA Declaration Form along with his/her claim.

If a round journey between multiple locations is being undertaken, then tax exemption shall not be given on the entire trip, but only on the expenses incurred on traveling between two farthest locations (up and down) in the trip.

In case the place of travel is not connected by train/air and is undertaken by road, an amount equivalent to AC first class fare for the distance of the journey by shortest route is reimbursable on the basis that the journey has been performed by rail. Original taxi bills shall be required as proof of travel in this case.

Employees need to avail a minimum of 3 working days leave to claim LTA. All LTA claims must be supported by the approved leave application and documents as mentioned in the policy.

# Process

LTA claims do not need the supervisor’s signature and should be sent directly to HR. The LTA claim should contain an Expense Claim along with the following supporting documents:

- If the journey is undertaken by air, then the original tickets along with boarding passes.
- If the journey is undertaken by railway, then the original train tickets.
- If the journey is undertaken by road, then the details need to be filled in a subscribed format, which is available with HR.

LTA claims shall not be processed if:

- Photocopies of bills/tickets are sent.
- Tickets are not sent with the claim form.
- The claim form is incomplete.
- Only a travel agent's bill without tickets is given.

In such a case, the concerned employee must inform the HR department about his/her decision to increase the contribution.

No Gratuity is payable if on the date of leaving the service the employee has not completed 1700 days of continuous service. However, in cases where termination of service is caused due to retrenchment, superannuation, death, physical disability of the employee, or transfer to any other associate/group company and the company to which he is transferred does not agree to take over the responsibility for payment of gratuity, the qualifying period of five years is not necessary for determining the eligibility for gratuity.

No Gratuity is payable if the services of an employee are terminated due to disciplinary action or if any action inquiry or legal suit is pending against the employee at the time of his leaving the service with the company. If an employee dies while in the services of the company, the amount of Gratuity payable in such an event is made payable to his/her spouse or, if there is no spouse, to his dependent children or other dependants.

# Performance Management Process

# Objective

- To provide a framework for systematic planning of performance objectives at the beginning of the year.
- To ensure congruence between individual objectives & organizational goals.
- To identify the gaps in performance for the purpose of development.

# Scope

All employees on rolls of the company will be eligible to participate in the performance management process; however, employees who have joined on or before the last day of October will be eligible for the financial increment arising out of this exercise in the same appraisal year.

# Process

The appraisal year is defined as the financial year i.e. April to March.

The process commences with a performance planning/goal setting exercise in which the Key Result Areas (KRAs) for all individuals are defined at the beginning of the year through a discussion between the employee and supervisor. The onus to set the KRAs for new joiners is on the new joinee and the supervisor. The KRAs should be submitted to KFSL HR duly approved by the CEO latest by 30 days after joining.

# Time Lines

The performance review has to be done quarterly, at the end of the financial year all the quarterly ratings are to be collated which helps in arriving at an annual rating for the individual.

1. At the end of the quarter, the employee has to fill in his achievements against the agreed KRAs. He/She also needs to allocate a score to the achievement based on the rating sheet below.
2. The employee will also define weightage (%) for every KRA. The sum total of all weights should be 100.
3. Appraisal discussion with supervisor: during the appraisal discussion between the supervisor and the employee, the supervisor will review the ratings provided by the employee and the relative weights allocated to individual KRAs.
4. The supervisor can alter the ratings/weights if he/she deems it fit.
5. The supervisor will then identify areas for improvement for the employee based on the discussion which have to be documented in the form.
6. Once there is consensus on the rating, the form has to be signed by the employee and the supervisor. (The employee can take a copy of the signed form for his records)
7. Post the rating by the supervisor, the same has to be reviewed by the skip level manager and subsequently by the CEO for manager level and above and division/region/vertical head.

For calculation of mandatory leave, paid holidays falling within the leave period will be counted as part of the leave.

To ensure that all employees avail their mandatory leave during the calendar year, it is recommended that all employees submit a tentative mandatory leave schedule to their Supervisors at the beginning of the year.

# Maternity Leave for Female Employees

Wherever applicable, maternity leave shall be governed by the provisions of the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961. This will apply to cases where an employee adopts a child also.

# Resignation and Exit Process

The Supervisor must accept the resignation, specify the last working day of the employee, and forward it to KFSL HR.

KFSL HR intimates Karvy Corporate HR of the resignation.

In cases where an employee named in a whistleblower report resigns, our practice would be to accept the resignation but not relieve the employee until the investigation is complete.

KSBL HR sends a clearance form to the employee, who obtains the relevant clearances and sends it back to KSBL HR on his/her last working day. Prior to the employee’s separation, an exit interview needs to be conducted and feedback documented.

In the case of employees up to Manager Level, the exit interview has to be conducted by at least a VP level resource and KSBL HR. For employees above the Manager level, the exit interview is to be conducted by the CEO and KSBL HR.

HR gets gratuity claim forms filled by the separated employee (in case eligible) and sends the same along with the other separation documents to the HO-HR team for Full and Final settlement processing of the employees.

Karvy Corporate HR dispatches the settlement amount, the settlement details, and the relieving letter to the employee, subject to receipt of the completed clearance form.

File the exit interview form, with the interviewer’s comments, resignation letter, and clearance form in the Personal Folder.

We would like to align our policy guidelines with employee needs as well as those of the organisation. Therefore, KFSL may change these policies at any time. This Manual is therefore designed to allow updates (deletions and additions) as and when the management of KFSL deems it necessary for the general benefit of the Employees and the Company.

As we move ahead, there will be changes that may need to be reflected in this manual. When such revisions occur, the Custodians will receive these updates along with directions to whether to replace a page in a particular policy or simply replace the entire policy within a section.

# Interview Guidelines

It is the responsibility of the interviewer to brief the candidate on the current role available, a brief background of the organization, the culture prevalent in the organization, and the location at which the role will be based.

# Basic Interviewing Guidelines:

- Do not make the candidate wait for more than 15 minutes.
- Be punctual and start the interview on time.
- Be presentable, greet the candidate, and ask for his well-being.
- Begin by talking about things of common interest to help break the ice.
- Ask open-ended questions and let the candidate do most of the talking.
- Do not intimidate the candidate even if his reply to your question is incorrect.
- Take notes during the interview.
- Explain the role in terms of expectations and responsibilities.
- Close by thanking the candidate for showing interest in our organization.
- Provide a realistic time frame for informing the candidate about the interview outcome.

For outstation candidates, a video conference (VC) should be preferred over a telephonic interview.

# Post-Interview Process:

The line manager and HR must fill up the interview assessment sheet (IAS) immediately after the interview while the experience is still fresh. This is a mandatory requirement for all interviews.

# Travel Reimbursement:

If a candidate travels from one city to another for an interview, the company will reimburse travel and incidentals. It is advised to schedule interviews so that candidates can return the same day. If not possible, accommodation will also be reimbursed. Eligibility for travel, boarding, and lodging will be according to the travel policy applicable to the candidate's proposed grade. Line managers are responsible for minimizing travel, and all travel must be pre-approved by the CEO and KFSL HR.

# Pre-employment Screening:

Once the line manager and HR agree on the candidate’s suitability, KFSL HR will conduct the following pre-employment checks:

- De-duplicate with the internal customer database (to check for any defaults).
- De-duplicate with the internal negative database (to check for any past interview history with the company).

Upon satisfactory results, KFSL HR will prepare a comparison sheet, which will be forwarded to the CEO for approval after recommendations from the line manager and interviewers. Once approved, the offered compensation and grade will be communicated to the candidate.

# Documents Required Before Offer Letter Release:

- Resume of the candidate.
- Interview assessment sheet filled by the line manager and HR.
- Clearance from the pre-employment checks.
- Photo ID proof.
- Last 2 months' salary slip.
- Copy of the last revision letter/appointment letter if no revision has been done.

# Joining Process

On acceptance of the offer letter, the prospective employee needs to communicate a tentative date of joining to HR. Once the employee joins the company, He/She is to be issued a formal appointment order. The appointment order can be issued by KFSL HR or Group Head HR.

# Notice Period Buy-Out

This option has to be exercised sparingly on a case-to-case basis. The line manager needs to keep in mind the level & criticality of the role before recommending for a buyout. The line manager needs to forward the requisition with the approximate amount to KFSL HR with a justification on the urgency of the recruit. KFSL HR will then get this approved by the CEO and Group Head HR. Desirably, the tenor of the buyout shall not exceed 30 days. This amount shall be reimbursed to the employee on production of proof of deduction and payment to the previous employer. However, in case the employee voluntarily terminates his/her employment within 12 months of joining, this amount will have to be recovered with his/her final settlement.

# Recruitment – Associate Trainee Program

# Objective

To provide business with resources for specific short-term projects simultaneously providing exposure to students who have to undertake projects as a part of their curriculum.

# Scope

All trainees hired.

# Process

Identification and grading of management institutes has to be an ongoing exercise. Based on this exercise, KFSL shall embark on identification of institutes from where associate trainees can be hired.

The plan should contain the following:

- Project guide
- Title of the project
- Department in which the project will be undertaken
- Stipend payable (if any)
- Date of start and tenure of the project

On approval of this plan from the CEO, KFSL HR will identify the institutes which can be visited to fulfill the requirement of trainees.

# Interview Process

The following grid has to be adhered to while interviewing and finalizing an Associate Trainee:

- Tier 1 & 2: CEO and KFSL HR
- Tier 3: VP level vertical head and KFSL HR

The interviewer is expected to understand the capabilities and requirements of the trainee. The project details like the title, tenor, etc. should be shared during the interview discussion. The prospective trainee also needs to submit an introduction letter from his institute.

On successful completion of the training, the trainee is to be issued a letter of completion.

# 2.4 Hiring of Relatives

# Objective

To ensure that wherever employees related to each other are working in the organisation, they are not in a position to influence the jobs, performance or career progression of one another.

The company’s recruitment philosophy is hiring purely on merit. There is no restriction on hiring of relatives till such time it does not create a potential conflict of interest. In order to avoid potential conflict of interest and to reduce the possibility of favouritism or appearance of favouritism, the following guidelines must be followed:

- No one is assigned to a position where he/she has the opportunity to check, process, review, approve, audit or otherwise affect the work of the other related employee.
- No one is assigned to a position where he/she can influence the salary progress or promotion of the related employee.

In case any employee knows of a situation that appears to be an opportunity for one employee to show favouritism to his/her relative, he/she should contact the KFSL HR.

Example of relatives, for the sake of understanding is Parents / In-laws, Spouse, Children, Siblings etc. However, the list is not limited to relations defined above.

# Process

The HR department maintains data on related employees and updates it on a monthly basis. This list is to be reviewed by HR/Compliance on a quarterly basis.

All new hires must declare in their joining kit, if they have any relatives working with the Karvy Group to the best of their knowledge.

# 3.0 Probation and Confirmation

# Objective

To provide for a time frame to the organisation to evaluate the “performance and culture fit” factor vis-à-vis the internal set standards. This also gives the individual time to understand his/her compatibility with the organisation.

# Scope

All new joinees at all levels will join on probation for a period of six months from their date of joining.

# Process

Step 1. (D-30) On completion of five months HR will send the necessary confirmation appraisal form to the supervisor.

# Performance Appraisal Process

1. Step 2: Within 10 days of receipt of the confirmation appraisal form, the supervisor should have a formal discussion with the appraisee. This discussion should revolve around the appraisee’s performance on KRA for the specific period, any limitations he/she has in executing his/her duties, etc.
2. Step 3: Post the personal discussion, the supervisor and the appraisee should arrive at a consensus on the performance during the last five months. In case they are not able to arrive at a consensus, the matter has to be referred to the skip level supervisor and HR. The decision of the skip level supervisor and HR shall be final.
3. Step 4: Based on the discussion, the supervisor needs to inform HR either on confirmation of services or extension of probation for the appraisee. Extension can be granted for a span of 1 to 3 months depending on the discussion of the supervisor, skip level manager, and HR. In case of extension of probation, the supervisor should share a performance improvement plan with the appraisee along with defined timelines for the achievement of the same. Whichever is the case, probation extension and confirmations have to be finally approved by the CEO.
4. Step 5: Confirmation/probation extension letter has to be issued to the appraisee. In case a probation extension letter is issued, it has to be accompanied with a copy of the performance improvement plan. The performance improvement plan has to be drafted by the line manager.
5. Step 6: (Only for probation extension cases) There has to be a fortnightly discussion on the appraisee’s progress on the performance improvement plan. Steps 1 to 5 have to be repeated while nearing the completion of the extended probation period. In case the employee under consideration does not scale up on performance parameters, the employee’s services can be terminated post discussion and approval of the immediate line manager, division/region/vertical head, CEO, and KFSL HR.

# Notice Period

Objective: To protect the interest of the organization during separation of employees.

Scope: All employees on rolls of the company.

# Notice Period Plan

|Level|On Probation|On Confirmation|
|---|---|---|
|Associate and Senior Associate|Nil|7 Days|
|Officer to Manager|15 Days|30 Days|
|Sr. Manager & above|30 Days|60 Days|

The company reserves the right to not accept compensation in lieu of notice period and make the employee serve partial or entire notice period. However, in the event an employee’s services are terminated for fraud, theft, or withholding of information or for any other form of misconduct, notice period will not be payable.

In case the place of travel is not connected by train/air and is undertaken by road, an amount equivalent to AC first class fare for the distance of the journey by shortest route is reimbursable on the basis that the journey has been performed by rail. Original taxi bills shall be required as proof of travel in this case.

Employees need to avail a minimum of 3 working days leave to claim LTA. All LTA claims must be supported by the approved leave application and documents as mentioned in the policy.

# Process

LTA claims do not need the supervisor’s signature and should be sent directly to HR. The LTA claim should contain an Expense Claim along with the following supporting documents:

- If the journey is undertaken by air, then the original tickets along with boarding passes.
- If the journey is undertaken by railway, then the original train tickets.
- If the journey is undertaken by road, then the details need to be filled in a subscribed format, which is available with HR.

LTA claims shall not be processed if:

# Objective

To comply with the statutory regulations governing employee provident fund.

# Eligibility

The benefit of Provident Fund is extended to all employees from the date of joining their services with the company under the Employee Provident Fund & Misc. Provisions Act, 1952.

An employee may increase his/her contribution under the Voluntary Provident Fund to a maximum of 20% of the Basic salary. This is an internally set limit, though there is no limit set by the act. In such a case, the concerned employee must inform the HR department about his/her decision to increase the contribution. This change can be effected only at the beginning of a new financial year.

The employer’s contribution remains fixed at 12% of Basic Salary per month.

# 5.10 Gratuity Benefit Policy

# Performance Management Process

# Objective

- To provide a framework for systematic planning of performance objectives at the beginning of the year.
- To ensure congruence between individual objectives & organizational goals.
- To identify the gaps in performance for the purpose of development.

# Scope

All employees on rolls of the company will be eligible to participate in the performance management process; however, employees who have joined on or before the last day of October will be eligible for the financial increment arising out of this exercise in the same appraisal year.

# Process

The appraisal year is defined as the financial year i.e. April to March.

The process commences with a performance planning/goal setting exercise in which the Key Result Areas (KRAs) for all individuals are defined at the beginning of the year through a discussion between the employee and supervisor. The onus to set the KRAs for new joiners is on the new joinee and the supervisor. The KRAs should be submitted to KFSL HR duly approved by the CEO latest by 30 days after joining.

# Time Lines

The performance review has to be done quarterly, at the end of the financial year all the quarterly ratings are to be collated which helps in arriving at an annual rating for the individual.

1. At the end of the quarter, the employee has to fill in his achievements against the agreed KRAs. He/She also needs to allocate a score to the achievement based on the rating sheet below.
2. The employee will also define weightage (%) for every KRA. The sum total of all weights should be 100.
3. Appraisal discussion with supervisor: during the appraisal discussion between the supervisor and the employee, the supervisor will review the ratings provided by the employee and the relative weights allocated to individual KRAs.
4. The supervisor can alter the ratings/weights if he/she deems it fit.
5. The supervisor will then identify areas for improvement for the employee based on the discussion which have to be documented in the form.
6. Once there is consensus on the rating, the form has to be signed by the employee and the supervisor. (The employee can take a copy of the signed form for his records)
7. Post the rating by the supervisor, the same has to be reviewed by the skip level manager and subsequently by the CEO for manager level and above and division/region/vertical head.

# Resignation and Exit Process

The Supervisor must accept the resignation, specify the last working day of the employee, and forward it to KFSL HR.

KFSL HR intimates Karvy Corporate HR of the resignation.

In cases where an employee named in a whistleblower report resigns, our practice would be to accept the resignation but not relieve the employee until the investigation is complete.

KSBL HR sends a clearance form to the employee, who obtains the relevant clearances and sends it back to KSBL HR on his/her last working day. Prior to the employee’s separation, an exit interview needs to be conducted and feedback documented.

In the case of employees up to Manager Level, the exit interview has to be conducted by at least a VP level resource and KSBL HR. For employees above the Manager level, the exit interview is to be conducted by the CEO and KSBL HR.

HR gets gratuity claim forms filled by the separated employee (in case eligible) and sends the same along with the other separation documents to the HO-HR team for Full and Final settlement processing of the employees.

Karvy Corporate HR dispatches the settlement amount, the settlement details, and the relieving letter to the employee, subject to receipt of the completed clearance form.

File the exit interview form, with the interviewer’s comments, resignation letter, and clearance form in the Personal Folder.

We would like to align our policy guidelines with employee needs as well as those of the organisation. Therefore, KFSL may change these policies at any time. This Manual is therefore designed to allow updates (deletions and additions) as and when the management of KFSL deems it necessary for the general benefit of the Employees and the Company.

As we move ahead, there will be changes that may need to be reflected in this manual. When such revisions occur, the Custodians will receive these updates along with directions to whether to replace a page in a particular policy or simply replace the entire policy within a section.

# Interview Guidelines

It is the responsibility of the interviewer to brief the candidate on the current role available, a brief background of the organization, the culture prevalent in the organization, and the location at which the role will be based.

# Basic Interviewing Guidelines:

- Do not make the candidate wait for more than 15 minutes.
- Be punctual and start the interview on time.
- Be presentable, greet the candidate, and ask for his well-being.
- Begin by talking about things of common interest to help break the ice.
- Ask open-ended questions and let the candidate do most of the talking.
- Do not intimidate the candidate even if his reply to your question is incorrect.
- Take notes during the interview.
- Explain the role in terms of expectations and responsibilities.
- Close by thanking the candidate for showing interest in our organization.
- Provide a realistic time frame for informing the candidate about the interview outcome.

For outstation candidates, a video conference (VC) should be preferred over a telephonic interview.

# Post-Interview Process:

The line manager and HR must fill up the interview assessment sheet (IAS) immediately after the interview while the experience is still fresh. This is a mandatory requirement for all interviews.

# Travel Reimbursement:

If a candidate travels from one city to another for an interview, the company will reimburse travel and incidentals. It is advised to schedule interviews so that candidates can return the same day. If not possible, accommodation will also be reimbursed. Eligibility for travel, boarding, and lodging will be according to the travel policy applicable to the candidate's proposed grade. Line managers are responsible for minimizing travel, and all travel must be pre-approved by the CEO and KFSL HR.

# Pre-employment Screening:

Once the line manager and HR agree on the candidate’s suitability, KFSL HR will conduct the following pre-employment checks:

- De-duplicate with the internal customer database (to check for any defaults).
- De-duplicate with the internal negative database (to check for any past interview history with the company).

Upon satisfactory results, KFSL HR will prepare a comparison sheet, which will be forwarded to the CEO for approval after recommendations from the line manager and interviewers. Once approved, the offered compensation and grade will be communicated to the candidate.

# Documents Required Before Offer Letter Release:

- Resume of the candidate.
- Interview assessment sheet filled by the line manager and HR.
- Clearance from the pre-employment checks.
- Photo ID proof.
- Last 2 months' salary slip.
- Copy of the last revision letter/appointment letter if no revision has been done.

# Joining Process

On acceptance of the offer letter, the prospective employee needs to communicate a tentative date of joining to HR. Once the employee joins the company, He/She is to be issued a formal appointment order. The appointment order can be issued by KFSL HR or Group Head HR.

# Notice Period Buy-Out

This option has to be exercised sparingly on a case-to-case basis. The line manager needs to keep in mind the level & criticality of the role before recommending for a buyout. The line manager needs to forward the requisition with the approximate amount to KFSL HR with a justification on the urgency of the recruit. KFSL HR will then get this approved by the CEO and Group Head HR. Desirably, the tenor of the buyout shall not exceed 30 days. This amount shall be reimbursed to the employee on production of proof of deduction and payment to the previous employer. However, in case the employee voluntarily terminates his/her employment within 12 months of joining, this amount will have to be recovered with his/her final settlement.

# 2.4 Hiring of Relatives

# Objective

To ensure that wherever employees related to each other are working in the organisation, they are not in a position to influence the jobs, performance or career progression of one another.

The company’s recruitment philosophy is hiring purely on merit. There is no restriction on hiring of relatives till such time it does not create a potential conflict of interest. In order to avoid potential conflict of interest and to reduce the possibility of favouritism or appearance of favouritism, the following guidelines must be followed:

- No one is assigned to a position where he/she has the opportunity to check, process, review, approve, audit or otherwise affect the work of the other related employee.
- No one is assigned to a position where he/she can influence the salary progress or promotion of the related employee.

In case any employee knows of a situation that appears to be an opportunity for one employee to show favouritism to his/her relative, he/she should contact the KFSL HR.

Example of relatives, for the sake of understanding is Parents / In-laws, Spouse, Children, Siblings etc. However, the list is not limited to relations defined above.

# Process

The HR department maintains data on related employees and updates it on a monthly basis. This list is to be reviewed by HR/Compliance on a quarterly basis.

All new hires must declare in their joining kit, if they have any relatives working with the Karvy Group to the best of their knowledge.

# 3.0 Probation and Confirmation

# Objective

To provide for a time frame to the organisation to evaluate the “performance and culture fit” factor vis-à-vis the internal set standards. This also gives the individual time to understand his/her compatibility with the organisation.

# Scope

All new joinees at all levels will join on probation for a period of six months from their date of joining.

# Process

Step 1. (D-30) On completion of five months HR will send the necessary confirmation appraisal form to the supervisor.

# Performance Appraisal Process

1. Step 2: Within 10 days of receipt of the confirmation appraisal form, the supervisor should have a formal discussion with the appraisee. This discussion should revolve around the appraisee’s performance on KRA for the specific period, any limitations he/she has in executing his/her duties, etc.
2. Step 3: Post the personal discussion, the supervisor and the appraisee should arrive at a consensus on the performance during the last five months. In case they are not able to arrive at a consensus, the matter has to be referred to the skip level supervisor and HR. The decision of the skip level supervisor and HR shall be final.
3. Step 4: Based on the discussion, the supervisor needs to inform HR either on confirmation of services or extension of probation for the appraisee. Extension can be granted for a span of 1 to 3 months depending on the discussion of the supervisor, skip level manager, and HR. In case of extension of probation, the supervisor should share a performance improvement plan with the appraisee along with defined timelines for the achievement of the same. Whichever is the case, probation extension and confirmations have to be finally approved by the CEO.
4. Step 5: Confirmation/probation extension letter has to be issued to the appraisee. In case a probation extension letter is issued, it has to be accompanied with a copy of the performance improvement plan. The performance improvement plan has to be drafted by the line manager.
5. Step 6: (Only for probation extension cases) There has to be a fortnightly discussion on the appraisee’s progress on the performance improvement plan. Steps 1 to 5 have to be repeated while nearing the completion of the extended probation period. In case the employee under consideration does not scale up on performance parameters, the employee’s services can be terminated post discussion and approval of the immediate line manager, division/region/vertical head, CEO, and KFSL HR.

# Notice Period

Objective: To protect the interest of the organization during separation of employees.

Scope: All employees on rolls of the company.

# Notice Period Plan

|Level|On Probation|On Confirmation|
|---|---|---|
|Associate and Senior Associate|Nil|7 Days|
|Officer to Manager|15 Days|30 Days|
|Sr. Manager & above|30 Days|60 Days|

The company reserves the right to not accept compensation in lieu of notice period and make the employee serve partial or entire notice period. However, in the event an employee’s services are terminated for fraud, theft, or withholding of information or for any other form of misconduct, notice period will not be payable.

Original taxi bills shall be required as proof of travel in this case.

Employees need to avail a minimum of 3 working days leave to claim LTA. All LTA claims must be supported by the approved leave application and documents as mentioned in the policy.

# Process

- If the journey is undertaken by air, then the original tickets along with boarding passes.
- If the journey is undertaken by railway, then the original train tickets.

# 5.9 Provident Fund Benefit Policy

# Objective

To comply with the statutory regulations governing employee provident fund.

# Eligibility

The benefit of Provident Fund is extended to all employees from the date of joining their services with the company under the Employee Provident Fund & Misc. Provisions Act, 1952.

An employee may increase his/her contribution under the Voluntary Provident Fund to a maximum of 20% of the Basic salary. This is an internally set limit, though there is no limit set by the act. In such a case, the concerned employee must inform the HR department about his/her decision to increase the contribution. This change can be effected only at the beginning of a new financial year.

The employer’s contribution remains fixed at 12% of Basic Salary per month.

# 5.10 Gratuity Benefit Policy

# Performance Management Process

# Objective

- To provide a framework for systematic planning of performance objectives at the beginning of the year.
- To ensure congruence between individual objectives & organizational goals.
- To identify the gaps in performance for the purpose of development.

# Scope

All employees on rolls of the company will be eligible to participate in the performance management process; however, employees who have joined on or before the last day of October will be eligible for the financial increment arising out of this exercise in the same appraisal year.

# Process

The appraisal year is defined as the financial year i.e. April to March.

The process commences with a performance planning/goal setting exercise in which the Key Result Areas (KRAs) for all individuals are defined at the beginning of the year through a discussion between the employee and supervisor. The onus to set the KRAs for new joiners is on the new joinee and the supervisor. The KRAs should be submitted to KFSL HR duly approved by the CEO latest by 30 days after joining.

# Time Lines

The performance review has to be done quarterly, at the end of the financial year all the quarterly ratings are to be collated which helps in arriving at an annual rating for the individual.

1. At the end of the quarter, the employee has to fill in his achievements against the agreed KRAs. He/She also needs to allocate a score to the achievement based on the rating sheet below.
2. The employee will also define weightage (%) for every KRA. The sum total of all weights should be 100.
3. Appraisal discussion with supervisor: during the appraisal discussion between the supervisor and the employee, the supervisor will review the ratings provided by the employee and the relative weights allocated to individual KRAs.
4. The supervisor can alter the ratings/weights if he/she deems it fit.
5. The supervisor will then identify areas for improvement for the employee based on the discussion which have to be documented in the form.
6. Once there is consensus on the rating, the form has to be signed by the employee and the supervisor. (The employee can take a copy of the signed form for his records)
7. Post the rating by the supervisor, the same has to be reviewed by the skip level manager and subsequently by the CEO for manager level and above and division/region/vertical head.

Employees on transfer / relocation will be entitled to stay at a hotel / company guesthouse for a period of 1 week. Any extension for staying at the guesthouse / hotel will need the prior approval of the CEO and Group Head HR.

For employees who stay in a hotel, entitlements of the Domestic Travel Policy will apply. Prior to the relocation, the employee can make one trip along with his / her spouse, to finalize accommodation etc. In case school admission is required for children, up to two children may accompany the parents on the same visit. Entitlement for travel would be governed by the Domestic Travel Policy.

# Resignation and Exit Process

The Supervisor must accept the resignation, specify the last working day of the employee, and forward it to KFSL HR.

KFSL HR intimates Karvy Corporate HR of the resignation.

In cases where an employee named in a whistleblower report resigns, our practice would be to accept the resignation but not relieve the employee until the investigation is complete.

KSBL HR sends a clearance form to the employee, who obtains the relevant clearances and sends it back to KSBL HR on his/her last working day. Prior to the employee’s separation, an exit interview needs to be conducted and feedback documented.

In the case of employees up to Manager Level, the exit interview has to be conducted by at least a VP level resource and KSBL HR. For employees above the Manager level, the exit interview is to be conducted by the CEO and KSBL HR.

HR gets gratuity claim forms filled by the separated employee (in case eligible) and sends the same along with the other separation documents to the HO-HR team for Full and Final settlement processing of the employees.

Karvy Corporate HR dispatches the settlement amount, the settlement details, and the relieving letter to the employee, subject to receipt of the completed clearance form.

File the exit interview form, with the interviewer’s comments, resignation letter, and clearance form in the Personal Folder.
